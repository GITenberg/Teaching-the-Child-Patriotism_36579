<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE APPEAL TO HISTORY</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let us suppose for a moment that any set of
men could succeed in sweeping away from them
all the influences of past ages. Suppose a race
of men whose minds had been suddenly deadened
to every recollection&mdash;can we imagine a condition
of such utter confusion and misery?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederic
Harrison.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>WE have been lately told by one of our
foremost educators that "the best schools
are expressly renouncing the questionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
duty of teaching patriotism by means of
history."</div>

<p>To some of us who have brought up
children, this startling statement came
like a bomb. If history is to be used,
as it certainly is used, in many of our "best
schools," in the teaching of political economy,
sociology, philosophy, psychology,
biology, religion and nearly everything
else, why should we not use it also in
teaching a child the value of his own
country, how dearly it has been bought,
and his duty to serve it?</p>

<p>When anybody undertakes to prove
that a child who hears, for instance the
story of the six "leading citizens" of Calais
offering their lives for the redemption
of their city, does not feel a deeper
sense of patriotism after it, he must prove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that the children whom most of us know
are exceptional.</p>

<p>See the widening eyes and working features
of children listening to a spirited
reading of "Horatius at the Bridge," or
"Herv&eacute; Riel," or the story of Nathan
Hale.</p>

<p>Your "educator" may say that all this
means merely an "emotional spasm."
What is that but interest or enthusiasm?
And what is more potent in moving the
will?</p>

<p>Most of our intelligent mothers can
testify that there seems to be nothing
which more rouses a child's loving consciousness
of his own land, and more enkindles
a desire to do something for it,&mdash;even
to die for it&mdash;than listening to these
fiery old tales of exalted patriotism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In an eloquent panegyric upon the influence
of a knowledge of history, President
Woolley of Mt. Holyoke College
says: "It is a circumscribed life which
has no vision into the past, which is familiar
only with present conditions and
forms of government, manners, customs
and beliefs. Such a life has no background,
no material for comparisons, no
opportunity to learn from the mistakes
of others, nor from their achievements."</p>

<p>And, in re-inforcement of the contention
that much besides general culture
and useful information is gained from the
study of the past, and especially from the
study of the classics, Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge during a recent session of the New
York Latin Club uttered a strong plea for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the study of Latin and Greek, as an incentive
to patriotism.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," he said, in effect,
"to read of 'the brave days of old,' of
Marathon and Salamis, of Martius Curtius,
Lycurgus and a hundred others of
the heroes of Greece and Rome, without
a sense of the glory of living and dying
for one's country. All children should
be made familiar with them, and especially
with the ringing lines and sound
patriotism of the Iliad. They not only
teach patriotism, but many of the other
higher virtues, and in such an interesting
way that children want to hear the
stories over and over. Thus their lessons
become indelibly impressed upon young
minds."</p>

<p>But one of the hard truths which should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be taught in connection with these tales
of heroism, is the fact that by far the
greater number of splendid sacrifices for
one's country are never heard of. Cincinnatus,
Hector, Ajax, Pheidippides,
have come to fame, which is generally
considered reward enough for any hardship;
but most of the world's heroes
are unknown or forgotten. Every soldier
can relate courageous deeds which he has
witnessed but which live only in his memory
or in those of his comrades. In fact,
we are told that heroism is so common in
the present war that almost every soldier
deserves a medal.</p>

<p>An interesting instance of obscure
heroism is quoted by Miss Repplier from
Sir Francis Doyle:</p>

<p>"Dr. Keate, the terrible head-master of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Eton, encountered one morning a small
boy crying miserably, and asked him what
was the matter. The child replied that
he was cold. 'Cold!' roared Keate.
'You must put up with cold, sir! You
are not at a girls' school.'</p>

<p>"The boy remembered the sharp appeal
to manhood; for fifteen years later,
with the Third Dragoons, he charged at
the strongly intrenched Sikhs (thirty
thousand of the best fighting men of the
Khalsa) on the curving banks of the
Sutlej. And, as the word was given, he
turned to his superior officer, a fellow-Etonian,
and chuckled, 'As old Keate
would say, "This is no girls' school,"' and
rode to his death on the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'battlefied'">battlefield</ins> of Sobraon,
which gave Lahore to England."</p>

<p>Thus does the true hero lay down his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
life, cheerfully and unrewarded, for his
country.</p>

<p>The anonymous hero, so numerous and
so grand, is well typified also by Browning's
"Echetlos," "The Holder of the
Ploughshare." This can be so read that
even children of eight or ten can take it
in.</p>

<p>One wishes that a real historical event
were commemorated in Browning's
"How They Brought the Good News
from Ghent to Aix"; but it has the heroic
ring, and fires the young imagination as
well, perhaps, as "An Incident of the
French Camp," which is said to be true,&mdash;another
story of an unnamed hero.</p>

<p>It will interest those same children to
hear Browning's ballad of "Pheidippides,"
who did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"&mdash;his part, a man's, with might<br />
And main, and not a faintest touch of fear."<br />
</div>

<p>The story should be told before the
poem is read.</p>

<p>It is a pity that Napoleon III proved
to be such a small man; for Mrs. Browning
made some wonderful lines about him,
which might well be read to children for
the promotion of patriotism. In "Casa
Guidi Windows" occur some of the finest
lines for the awakening of true patriotism,
that can be found in our language, yet
they are seldom mentioned by writers on
this subject. The best should be read, a
few at a time, often in the family circle.</p>

<p>From the history of the Crimean War
many striking tales of patriotism can be
culled, such as incidents in the life of
Lord Raglan and the careers of the wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Napiers, who were connected even
more closely with the Peninsular War.
Girls will especially find joy and inspiration
in the story of Florence Nightingale.
Boys and girls alike will revel in Mrs.
Laura E. Richards' charmingly written
"Life" of that heroine.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to speak rather slightingly
of the patriotic poems which were
thundered from the old lyceum-platforms
by our forefathers, but many of them naturally
possess the spirit of the first patriots,
and thus are of especial value to our
children. It goes without saying that
every child should early become familiar
with the lives of George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln. Show them that such
men "set the pace" for America, and
taught us what true patriotism really is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington's Farewell Address should
be read often in every American Family,
and portions of it should be known by
heart to every American child. So
should Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, as
well as portions of his other great
speeches. The stories should be often rehearsed
to them of Joseph Warren, Israel
Putnam, John Paul Jones, Decatur, Marcus
Whitman, Grant, Sherman, Sheridan,
Lee, Jackson and our other heroes of war
and peace. Many of their achievements
have been celebrated in worthy verse.
The great orations of Daniel Webster,
Edward Everett, Wendell Phillips, William
Lloyd Garrison and others, and the
magnificent state papers of Woodrow
Wilson, are well calculated to stir the
spirit of true patriotism in the hearts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of noble children, and they should not
be ignorant of those splendid compositions.</p>

<p>A year or more before the great war, a
young man was speaking lightly one evening
of "all this sentimental rot about
'love of country'"; how it showed "that
a man hadn't traveled," and is "provincial."
He spoke in the tone affected by
a certain class of blas&eacute;, hypersophisticated
youths, who might well be punished by
the same means that were used for Edward
Everett Hale's "Man Without a
Country,"&mdash;another book which all older
children should know.</p>

<p>The boy had recently returned from a
long sojourn abroad. His mother was
horrified to hear his words, though she
had detected an unsoundness in his views<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ever since he had come back. Still, she
said nothing at the moment. She wanted
to think it over.</p>

<p>One evening shortly afterward the family
were assembled on the broad porch.
Several guests were present. It was
warm, but a soft breeze blew in from the
moonlighted Hudson just below them.
Some one suggested that it was just the
time for poetry. Why should not every
one recite his favorite poem?</p>

<p>They began. One gave Rudyard Kipling's
stirring "Song of the English."
Another followed with a portion of
Tennyson's "Ode on the Death of the
Duke of Wellington," beginning with the
familiar words,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Not once nor twice in our rough island story,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The path of duty was the way to glory,"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>and ending with the fine repetition,</div>

<div class='poem'>
"And keep the soldier firm, the statesman pure;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till in all lands and through all human story,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The path of duty be the way to glory."</span><br />
</div>

<p>By this time, the party of eight or ten
cultivated people were all plainly affected.
The one who sat next said, "I
was going to recite 'The Antiseptic Baby,'&mdash;and,
of course, that is always good, but
it doesn't seem to chime in with our mood
to-night. I used to know Daniel Webster's
great speech on the Constitution.
Maybe I can recall it," and slowly he
rolled forth the stately words.</p>

<p>When the mother's turn came, she
begged them not to groan if she should
give them a very well-worn selection, and
started out upon Walter Scott's, "Lives
There a Man with Soul so Dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some derision in the laugh
which greeted her first words, but all were
soon caught in the swirl of the great sentiment,
and when she came to the line "Unwept,
unhonored and unsung," there was
long applause, the blas&eacute; youth joining in
most heartily of all.</p>

<p>"That's an old corker, isn't it, mother!"
he cried. "I'd forgotten that it was so
lively. There's a lot in it."</p>

<p>She knew that his ideas were being
cleared.</p>

<p>All of this heroism and love of country
is represented by our flag. Its meaning
should be explained to our children.
Teaching them to salute it, and to repeat
the words which go with the salute, becomes
a mere form unless they understand
its deeper significance. Henry Ward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Beecher once gave a noble interpretation
of it, which has been amplified by Secretary
Franklin K. Lane in an address to
the employees of the Department of the
Interior. Only a few words of it can be
given here, but your children should hear
or read them all.</p>

<p>The Flag seemed to say to him: "The
work that we do is the making of the Flag.
I am not the Flag at all. I am but its
shadow. I am all that you hope to be
and have the courage to try for.</p>

<p>"I am the day's work of the weakest
man and the largest dream of the most
daring. I am the Constitution and the
courts, statutes and statute-makers, soldier
and dreadnaught, drayman and
street-sweep, cook, counselor and clerk.
I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of color, the pictured suggestion of that
big thing which makes this nation. My
stars and stripes are your dream and your
labors. They are bright with cheer, brilliant
with courage, firm with faith, because
you have made them so,&mdash;for you
are the makers of the Flag."</p>

<p>This is no mere sentimental fancy.</p>

<p>The thrill of the flag is best understood
by those who have seen it on a foreign
shore; but the deepest thrill of all comes
on beholding the flag which bears the
marks of shot and shell.</p>

<p>A little boy of six, who had been considered
in his family as unemotional, was
one day riding with his mother past a
public building, gaily decorated with
bunting. Among the unstained banners
above the entrance hung a cluster of old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
battle-flags. The child gazed at them
with the greatest interest. Then he
turned suddenly to his mother.</p>

<p>"Which do you like best, mother?" he
asked. "The bright new flags, or the
old, ragged flags that have been in the
battle?"</p>

<p>"Which do you like best?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, while his little lip
quivered, "I like best the old, ragged
flags that have been in the battle,&mdash;don't
you?"</p>

<p>This child had been brought up from
infancy upon the stories and poems of the
patriots of the past, but he had never
shown before such a marked effect from
them. This effect grew with his years.</p>

<p>The most stolid and selfish child can
be made into a fervid patriot, I firmly believe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by a proper use of the great patriotic
literature.</p>

<p>Until within a short time, some of us
have deprecated the idea of filling the
minds of our children with visions of killing
and of killers, however brave and
noble. But we have learned that, as long
as there are barbarians in the world
threatening to overwhelm civilization, the
arts of war must still be practiced. History
has described civilizations as good
as ours, perhaps better, which were destroyed
by barbarians, physically stronger
than the gentler races which they attacked.
So long as powerful tribes exist,
covetous of the wealth and the territory
of their neighbors, and willing to trample
down everybody and everything else to
get them, what can we do but fight?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Tis man's perdition to be safe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When for the truth he ought to die."</span><br />
</div>

<p>That means, in the terms of to-day, that
we must still sing to our children the glories
of war. Americans properly hate
war. It is antiquated, out of date,&mdash;utterly
opposed to the spirit of the twentieth
century. We should bring up our children
to see that it is just that, and that we
are fighting now simply because otherwise
barbarism would overspread the
world,&mdash;a barbarism which includes autocracy
and militarism as its chief features,
two elements which are intolerable
in a world of democracy.</p>

<p>And yet war is often a purifying fire.
It has its noble and uplifting side. This
is the side which is emphasized in the
heroic tales which have been mentioned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and which makes for the development
of patriotism in the child and in the
man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PATRIOTISM OF PEACE</div>

<div class='poem'>
The great mind knows the power of gentleness&mdash;<br />
Only tries force because persuasion fails.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Browning.</span></span><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE patriotism of war is far easier to
teach than the patriotism of peace. When
bands are playing and the love of adventure
is calling, men find it easy to march
away to battle for their country, and boys
and girls throb through all their young
beings to do something for it.</div>

<p>But when men are staying at home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with comfort beckoning; with the government
jogging along and getting the
main things done somehow or other, under
the guidance of professional politicians;
and with one's personal affairs requiring
apparently the application of all
one's mortal powers,&mdash;then patriotism
needs a spur.</p>

<p>It was of such "piping times of peace"
that Goldsmith wrote:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where wealth accumulates and men decay."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The task set forth before the conscientious
citizen then is to keep alive in himself
the clear torch of patriotism,&mdash;which
simply means the duty to sacrifice as
freely, in proportion to the need, in time
of peace as in time of war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the difficulty of this task, seldom
yet accomplished, which has led to the
many eloquent panegyrics, in all languages,
upon war as necessary to the very
existence of a nation. Several entire
books have been written to prove that
sordidness and selfishness always possess
and soon destroy a nation which does not
have frequent wars. The philosophy of
Nietzsche is largely founded upon this
theory. Treitschke and Bernhardi follow
him closely. Even De Quincey, Ruskin,
and others from among our best English
writers, subscribe to this monstrous
doctrine, and it is true that there is plenty
of support for it in history.</p>

<p>But we Americans have always believed
in brains rather than brawn for the
settlement of international as well as personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
controversies. The duel has been
banished from our country as an antiquated
means of adjusting the quarrels
of individual men, and logic requires that
a similar course be pursued toward quarrels
on a larger scale. Because we have
been obliged to lay aside temporarily our
convictions in order to save ourselves and
the right, from a mad dog of a nation,
which threatens to overthrow civilization,
does not mean that we have given up our
ideals. If the American nation stands for
anything, it stands for peace, though we
can and will fight if liberty and right are
threatened.</p>

<p>In the study of the Iliad which has been
suggested, the words which Agamemnon
speaks to Hector should be especially
commended to children:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Cursed be the man, and void of law and right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unworthy property, unworthy light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unfit for public rule or private care,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The wretch, the monster, who delights in war,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To tear his country and his kind destroy."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But in the face of the almost universal
testimony against it, all of us should realize
that extraordinary pains must be taken
to inculcate the truth, and live it, that
high patriotism can be kept alive in peace
as well as in war.</p>

<p>Precept alone goes not very far in any
line, and less, perhaps, in this, than in any
other. The study of history and a little
of the most modern literature, helps.
Classical literature, in all languages,
preaches with frightful unanimity, the
necessity and the nobility of war. In the
religion of Rome, Mars received ten times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more homage than did Jupiter. The
book and the precept must not be neglected,
but your chief weapon in teaching
your child the patriotism of peace must be
the deed. You must set a strenuous example,
or else all your words will pass
like the whistle of the wind.</p>

<p>In President Hadley's inaugural, he asserted
that the main object of education is
to make good citizens,&mdash;which is, perhaps,
only another way of saying that the
chief object of education is to make patriots.</p>

<p>He was talking of the education of the
schools; but Emerson somewhere says, in
effect, that though we send our children to
the schoolmaster, it is, after all, their environment
which does most of the educating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Emerson speaks of the shop-windows
along the child's way; but it is his home
which forms the most influential factor
in his environment; and the part of the
home usually dearest to him is his mother.
It is a common saying, especially in our
cities, that fathers see their children only
when they are asleep, leaving them at
breakfast-time, and returning after they
have gone to bed. Up to the age of
twelve, or thereabout, children should
retire shortly after eight o'clock. During
the next few years, even though
they sit up later, they generally have to
study. Thus, during their formative
period, it is upon the mother that the
home training of the children chiefly
devolves.</p>

<p>A distinguished clergyman in a public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
address once eulogized his mother. He
attributed to her every virtue and a wonderful
mind. He was a violent anti-suffragist,
and supposed that he was presenting
a strong argument for his side when
he said, "But though my incomparable
mother counseled us upon almost every
subject that could engage our attention,
she never mentioned to us the subject of
politics."</p>

<p>Had he not struck, perhaps, the main
reason for the corruption of our politics?
The fathers have no chance to instruct
their young children in the rudiments of
politics,&mdash;yet those children ought to be
so instructed by somebody. They get little
or nothing of it in school. If their
mother does not teach them something
about it, they will probably grow up ignorant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of many of its snares and its opportunities.</p>

<p>To-day the anti-suffragists are wiser.
They say that women should understand
civic duties and should canvass them
thoroughly with their children. The
sin and the shame come only, in their
opinion, when women actually vote for
the best men and women to fill the offices.</p>

<p>The case is as if a woman should furnish
a house, supplying its kitchen with
every facility for cooking and cleaning;
fitting its dining-room with the proper
linen, silver and china; arranging its bedrooms
for comfortable sleep; making its
parlors beautiful for guests; and then,
though she has known so well the needs of
a household and how to provide for them,
she draws back from the responsibility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
running her model house, as if to say:
"My sisters and I are not competent to
manage this house. You men are far
abler. Please make and enforce all the
rules to govern it."</p>

<p>Let the men and the women work together,
dividing the responsibility according
to the fitness of each individual.
There are stupid men and stupid women
and there are bright men and bright
women. Women are human beings before
all else and all human interests are
their interests. There is among us too
much of cowardice and laziness, posing as
hyper-refinement and modesty. Women
as voters, "weavers of peace," as the old
Saxons called them, are bound to be
a helpful force in many departments,
and especially in this great work of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
establishing universal peace, and
teaching men how to use it. They
should begin with the child in its
cradle.</p>

<p>For, let us repeat, it cannot be too
strongly impressed that the underlying
and fundamental principles of politics
must be taught by the mother, if they are
taught at all; and like everything else
that is good, they can be and should be
taught. It does not seem to be generally
understood, but it is a fact, that a
training in politics is possible, and if our
great experiment in government is to succeed,
such a training should be given to
every child, and the mother seems to be
the natural, and often the only person to
give it.</p>

<p>A mother was one day walking along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the streets of the great city in which she
lived, when she saw that a new liquor-saloon
had been opened within two blocks
of her home.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said to her little boy
of eight, who held her hand, "Here is
another saloon,&mdash;another place where
men will spend their money foolishly and
perhaps become drunkards,&mdash;and so near
our own home! We have never had one
so near before."</p>

<p>As she spoke, two men staggered out
from the saloon-door and made their way
unsteadily along the sidewalk. The child
had never seen a drunken man before.
His eyes widened with horror and an expression
of utter disgust settled upon his
eager little face.</p>

<p>"Why do they let 'em do it!" he burst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
forth. "Aren't there any Christians in
Congress?"</p>

<p>It was plain that ideas of law and restraint,
and of the difference between good
government and bad government, were
struggling for form and coherence in the
child's mind.</p>

<p>The mother seized her opportunity.
She explained briefly some of the evils of
the saloon; the meaning of "high license"
and "prohibition," and something of the
arguments on both sides; how most good
people agree that the saloon, as at present
conducted, is a cancer on the body politic,
and how the chief disagreement is concerning
the best ways of controlling or
suppressing it; how the liquor men are
active in politics, while the temperance
men are so busy with their own affairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and usually so contemptuous of legislatures
that they do not look carefully after
the laws; how voters are often bribed;
and as many more details as the boy
seemed to want to hear.</p>

<p>He listened closely and asked many intelligent
questions. He had received a
lesson in politics which he did not forget,
as his chance remarks showed for months
afterward. He talked the matter over
with his younger brothers, and they, too,
began to ask questions. During the next
few years that mother gave her boys brief
talks on arbitration, the tariff, public education
and its bearing on democracy,
street-cleaning, road-making, silver and
gold money, and many other topics of current
politics. She was careful never to
force them, for she knew that it is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
when the mood is upon him that a boy
likes to discuss serious subjects. The
terms she used were of the simplest; and
her husband, who was deeply interested in
her efforts, and helped her whenever he
could, supplied her with many illustrations,
such as children could understand.
Especially did she impress upon her children's
minds the true and striking saying
of a great Frenchman, that "governments
are always just as bad as the people
will let them be"; and that, as a part
of the people, it was their duty to see
that the government was made and kept
good.</p>

<p>By "line upon line, precept upon precept,"
knowing that opinions are formed</p>

<div class='poem'>
"As boys learn to spell,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By reiteration chiefly."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>this mother tried to impress upon those
children the duties of good citizenship.
They are grown up now and show the effects
of their training.</div>

<p>Many of us feel that more upon the subject
of politics,&mdash;again we should remind
ourselves that politics and patriotism are
very nearly the same thing,&mdash;might easily
and properly be taught in our public
schools; for the foundation principles of
politics are only those of ordinary ethics.
In this way, morality, which is far more
necessary than book-learning for the perpetuity
of our institutions, would take that
dominant place in our educational system,
so strongly advocated by that prince of
educators, Horace Mann. "Among all
my long list of acquaintances," he says, "I
find that for one man who has been ruined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for want of intellectual attainments, hundreds
have perished for want of morals.
And yet we go on bestowing one hundred
times more care and pains and cost on the
education of the intellect than on the cultivation
of the moral sentiments and the
establishment of moral principles." He
insists that morals should be regularly
taught, and not "left to casual and occasional
mention."</p>

<p>Thus broad and clear ideas of perfect
honesty, with Abraham Lincoln and
other good and great men as examples,
form the foundation of clean politics, and
should be impressed upon the children in
our schools. The daily papers often describe
shining instances of this cardinal
virtue.</p>

<p>Suppose that a theater is burned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
many lives lost. Laws may have been
passed for the safeguarding of theaters,
but the manager of this house disregarded
them in order to save a few dollars.
There is a chance to impress regard for
law and its enforcement.</p>

<p>Or suppose that bribery is under discussion.
Here is a true story of the way
in which its devious methods were impressed
upon the mind of a small boy:</p>

<p>He was stopping with his mother in a
country town, when the tailor of the place,
in speaking of the day's voting, remarked:
"I don't gen'ally vote, but I did to-day,
because they sent a carriage up from the
Center for me. It takes time to vote and
'tain't much use. What does one vote
amount to anyway? But when one of the
bosses is anxious enough to come an' git<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
me, why, then I'll vote, or if they'll give
me my fare on the cars."</p>

<p>"Why," said the boy quickly, "isn't that
bribery?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" said the man, shuffling
about uneasily. "That jest pays me for
my time an' trouble. I don't git nothin'
for my <i>vote</i>."</p>

<p>Sophistries like this should be immediately
made clear to the child. It would
probably be impossible to show them to
that tailor.</p>

<p>"Our Revolutionary fathers," said
Horace Mann again, "abandoned their
homes, sacrificed their property, encountered
disease, bore hunger and cold, and
stood on the fatal edge of battle, to gain
that liberty which their descendants will
not even go to the polls to protect. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Pilgrim Fathers expatriated themselves,
crossed the Atlantic,&mdash;then a greater enterprise
than now to circumnavigate the
globe,&mdash;and braved a savage foe, that they
might worship God unmolested,&mdash;while
many of us throw our votes in wantonness,
or for a bribe, or to gratify revenge."</p>

<p>This is a terrible indictment. It is not
as true now as it was in the time of Horace
Mann. Still, the lesson contained in it
should be impressed upon our children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN POLITICS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let us have faith that right makes might, and
in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty
as we understand it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>DURING the last few years the magazines
have published many helpful series
upon politics and a number of these deserve
especial credit for their work in this
line. In one of these articles the writer
reminds us that though the sins of our
time are the same old sins which were denounced
by Jeremiah and Ezekiel, they
are likely now to be enameled with fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
new exteriors and called by new names.
"Especially, the current methods of annexing
the property of others are characterized
by an indirectness and refinement
very grateful to the natural feelings."</div>

<p>This is terribly true, and the child
should be made aware of it. A dazzling
outside may cover a black heart. Illustrate
this fact to him by the story of those
beautiful flowers whose sweet odor is
laden with death. Tell him of William
M. Tweed, whose gigantic thefts almost
bankrupted a great city, yet who read a
chapter in his Bible every day, and who
possessed many kind and even noble qualities.
Many other public men of ancient
and modern times will afford equally
striking examples of inconsistency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain excellent country gentleman,
who did not realize the possible deceitfulness
of the outside, went down to the
capital of his state to see about some bills
which vitally affected his business. He
had written to the Senator from his section
that he was coming and had asked for
an appointment to meet him. He had
never met this man, but the papers had
criticized him severely, and our friend
was prepared to encounter a mean and
churlish creature.</p>

<p>"Instead," he reported upon his return
to his home, "I found him a perfect gentleman.
He met me at the train and took
me to my hotel in his own automobile, and
invited me to dine with him the next day.
He lives in a beautiful home. I was surprised
to see what kind of a man he really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is. You would think by the way the
papers go on about him that he had horns
and hoofs, but," he repeated, "he was a
perfect gentleman."</p>

<p>Yet this man was one of the most dangerous
"practical politicians" in the state&mdash;one
of those who believe that the Ten
Commandments have no place in politics,
and who scrupled at nothing which could
benefit himself and his friends. He simply
could not understand a man who
could "swear to his own hurt and change
not."</p>

<p>"Unlike the old-time villain," says Mr.
E. A. Reed, "the latter-day malefactor
does not wear a slouch-hat and a comforter,
and breathe forth curses and an
odor of gin. Fagin and Bill Sykes and
Simon Legree are vanishing types. Good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
kindly men let the wheels of commerce
and industry redden rather than pare their
dividends, and our railroads yearly injure
one employee in twenty-six, while we look
in vain for that promised day of the Lord,
which shall make 'a man more precious
than fine gold.'"</p>

<p>And, again, "The tropical belt of sin
into which we are now sweeping is largely
impersonal. The hurt passes into that
vague mass, 'the public,' and is there lost
to view. Hence it does not take a Borgia
to knead 'chalk and alum and plaster' into
the loaf, seeing that one cannot know just
who will eat that loaf. The purveyor of
spurious life-preservers need not be a
Cain. The owner of rotten tenements,
whose 'pull' enables him to ignore the orders
of the Health Department, fore-dooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
babies, it is true, but for all that, he
is no Herod.</p>

<p>"Often there are no victims. If the
crazy hulk sent out for 'just one more trip'
meets with fair weather, all is well.
Briber and grafter are now 'good men,'
and would have passed for virtuous in the
American community of seventy years
ago. Therefore, people do not always see
that boodling is treason; that blackmail is
piracy, that tax-dodging is larceny. The
cloven hoof hides in patent leather, and
to-day, as in Hosea's time, the people are
destroyed for lack of knowledge."</p>

<p>Let us see to it that our children are not
so destroyed.</p>

<p>In the old abolition days, Mr. Emerson
wrote: "What an education in the public
spirit of Massachusetts have been the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
speeches and reading of our public
schools! Every district school has been
an anti-slavery convention for these two
or three years last past."</p>

<p>Special policies cannot often be taught
like this in the modern public school,
but the broad principles of pure politics
can and should be.</p>

<p>For instance, a lesson in Civil Service
management may be given without once
uttering those words, simply by teaching
the sentiment well uttered by Ruskin:
"The first necessity of social life
is the clearness of the national conscience
in enforcing the law,&mdash;<i>that he should
keep who has justly earned</i>."</p>

<p>Children can be taught the dangers, not
only to their principles, but their worldly
fortunes, of office-seeking and of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a profession of politics. The child of
wealth should be especially instructed in
his duty to look after the affairs of his
own town, county, state and nation. The
man whose powers are strained to the utmost
in order to support and educate his
family, can of necessity give little time to
the searching out of civic wrongs and
their remedies. The well-to-do citizen
must give all the more to make up for
the limitations of his poorer neighbor.</p>

<p>Children can be taught, too, something
of the protean forms of bribery, the
schemes for trading votes; the duty of
every voter to vote and do jury-work;
the need of looking at every question
from both sides; of avoiding blind partisanship;
and much of the rest of the
elementary ethics of politics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>And, again, it is upon the mother that
this patriotic duty must chiefly devolve.
As with all of her training, she may often
feel that the work is slow and uncertain,
but she may well take to heart the encouraging
words of the poet:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thou canst not see grass grow, how sharp soe'er thou be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet that the grass has grown, thou presently shall see.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So, though thou canst not see thy work now prospering, know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The fruit of every work-time without fail shall show."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Jacob Riis used often to say that the
apparent corruption of our politics was
largely due to crass ignorance. There
are, too, many human beings who are born
moral idiots, who cannot be made to understand
ethics, any more than intellectual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"subnormals" can be made to understand
proportion and international law.
But we know that up to the ability of
every being he should be taught. We
know that the appalling illiteracy of
Mexico, Russia and China renders a
stable republic in any one of them almost
impossible. Education is a slow
business. Generations of it will be required
to make those countries what they
ought to be; but it is the desideratum
to successful republicanism. Therefore
it is vital that we guard our public
schools.</p>

<p>But again it must be emphasized that
though school discipline should be of
the best, yet the real education of your
child depends more upon his home than
upon his school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>What newspapers are lying around
there? What magazines? Do you patronize
salacious plays? Do you exalt in
your conversation the prize-fight and the
automobile-race? What sort of people
visit your home?</p>

<p>What sort of conversation goes on at
your table? Is wine or beer served there?
Is the air in your parlor or study often
thick with tobacco-smoke?</p>

<p>The father who wishes his children to
become pure-minded and unselfish patriots,
must ask himself many questions
like these. Remember that the boy is influenced
by your words only to a certain
degree. Our seer of Concord never uttered
a more impressive truth than when
he pictured a youth as demanding of his
father, "How can I hear what you <i>say</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when what you <i>are</i> is thundering so loud
in my ears?"</p>

<p>You can bring very near to your boy
and your girl, the responsibility of us all
for good home government, by mentioning
often to them the burning issues in
their home town. In many of our towns
and villages, one part of the city or township
is jealous of another part, will not
vote for improvements there and is generally
suspicious and contrary.</p>

<p>Explain to your children how contemptible
such an attitude is. Weigh for
them the arguments on both sides, and
make them help you to decide justly how
you ought to vote. Make the girl, especially,
form an opinion. On her may
devolve the future political training of influential
citizens. In fact, she may herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
be a Member of Congress or a United
States Senator!</p>

<p>Are the roads bad in your town? Are
the taxes improperly collected? Are the
schools inferior or managed by politicians?
Is the town poorly policed? Are
the back yards unsanitary? Are the town
officers inefficient?</p>

<p>Explain to your children how the taxes
are laid,&mdash;how a town has to spend a good
deal to keep itself up, so to speak; and
how important it is that its tax-money
should be carefully spent.</p>

<p>Particularly should we impress it upon
our children that if a town is a slipshod,
ugly or unhealthy place, it is not the fault
of a vague, formless thing, called "the
town" or "the city," or "the state," but
of each and every one of us; and especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of every separate voter who fails
to be on hand at the town-meetings
or caucuses, and to try his best to get
good men elected and good measures
passed.</p>

<p>An American was riding in a cab
through the streets of Vienna, some years
before the war, reading his mail. As he
finished with certain letters, he tore them
up and threw the fragments out of the
cab-window. The driver soon began to
notice what was going on, left his box and
picked up the torn papers. Then he put
his head in at the window, and cried, with
a passion which seemed to the careless
and untidy American quite uncalled-for,
"What do you mean by littering up our
beautiful streets in this way? Where do
you come from? Have your people no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
pride in their country? Do they wish it
to look all over like a slum?"</p>

<p>He actually reported the matter to the
police. The man was thereupon haled to
court and had to pay a considerable fine.</p>

<p>Although some of our cities, as well as
foreign ones, carry civic pride to an almost
ridiculous extent, it is a good fault.
Children should early be taught to regard
the neatness and beauty of their town.</p>

<p>If they complain that these matters are
hard to remember and to do, give them to
understand that patriotism is not easy.
Few virtues are easy to practice, and perhaps
unselfish patriotism is the hardest
of all.</p>

<p>A young man graduated from that
great American university where it is
said that citizenship is most strenuously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
taught, and where he had certainly imbibed
a lofty desire to do his duty by his
country. He lived in a great city and
presented himself in due time after his
graduation at the door of his ward political
organization. There he met with
an experience something like this:</p>

<p>A gentleman, plethoric and red-faced,
welcomed him, asked his name and address,
and gave him "the glad hand." At
the same time, he showed a spice of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Are you a Republican?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have always voted the
straight ticket?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I have been voting only a year
or two. I think I have voted the straight
ticket so far."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I suppose you intend to vote the
straight ticket right along?"</p>

<p>"I may or I may not," said the youth,
with some spirit. "I reserve for myself
the right to vote for the best candidate,
especially in local affairs."</p>

<p>"Then,&mdash;ahem&mdash;perhaps you haven't
got into just the right place. This is a
straight organization, you know. Maybe
you can find an 'independent'" (pronounced
with scorn) "organization somewhere
in the ward. I rather think that
is where you belong. We have found
these 'independents' a sort of obstruction
to the transaction of business,&mdash;a kind of
kickers, you know, though of course, you
might not turn out so. Still,"&mdash;with decision,&mdash;"you
really don't belong here."</p>

<p>"I was mad clear through," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
youth, in relating the story later. "I was
disgusted with the looks of the man and
with those who were in there with him.
I just turned on my heel and left, and I
haven't darkened that door again."</p>

<p>Was that patriotic? Was not that boy
deliberately turning over the government
of his city to "boodlers" and "grafters"?</p>

<p>"But," you may say, "should he have
stayed on where he was not wanted?"</p>

<p>Certainly he should. He had a right
there, as any citizen had. He should have
taken time to find other voters like himself,
which he could no doubt have done,
and together they could have maintained
themselves. He saw that this man and
his companions were not proper persons
to have control of an organization of his
party, and he should have done his best,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
even at the sacrifice of considerable time,
to oust them and get better men in. He
was no patriot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TEACHING THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In a country like ours, there is a public opinion
of almost uncontrollable power. The educated and
the intellectual may have a decisive voice in its
formation; or they may live in their own selfish
enjoyments, and suffer the ignorant and depraved
to form that public opinion.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace Mann.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>ONE of the most irritating things in the
world to a true patriot, is the visitor at
his table, who exalts the superiority of
other nations to our own.</div>

<p>Not that nearly every other nation may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not have some one or more points of
superiority, which should be acknowledged
and emulated; but your worshiper
of the foreign usually makes a blanket
indictment of America.</p>

<p>One such man was a guest at a certain
table just before the war. He had recently
returned from a long stay in
Europe, where his great wealth and important
commercial and social connections
gave him access to many of the circles
which largely control the life over
there.</p>

<p>"How are the people abroad thinking
of us nowadays?" inquired his hostess
rather lightly. "Do they despise us as
much as ever?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the great man
emphatically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I hope you stood up for us?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could say that I did," he had
the effrontery to reply calmly; "but how
could I? They consider that the corruption
of our government is so bad that it
cannot possibly continue very long. I
couldn't deny it, could I? I agreed with
them entirely that we were nearly at the
end of our rope."</p>

<p>"Really?" gasped his hostess. "Are
you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"I never was more so in my life. Look
at the condition of affairs in Blank
and Blank and Blank,"&mdash;naming several
states in which legislative scandals had
been lately unearthed,&mdash;"How long do
you think that things can go on like that
and a government survive? I had to admit
that a democratic form of government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is a failure. Of course, it was a
great dream of the fathers, but it has
proved to be as impracticable as a good
many other rainbow visions. Sometime
the world may be ready for it, but it evidently
is not now."</p>

<p>"And what do you think will follow?"
asked his hostess, holding on to her temper
with difficulty. "Are you in favor
of an autocracy like Germany, or of a limited
monarchy like Great Britain? Or
do you think an oligarchy a better form?
And if we decide on a monarchy, where
should we get our royal family? Should
we elect one from candidates that present
themselves? Or should we request
Europe to send us one?"</p>

<p>"Now you are making fun of me," he
commented with some feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, not exactly," she laughed.
"But really, if Europe is unanimous in
thinking our republic a failure, there
must be 'something in it.' You have been
in many countries and have met the leading
people, and you know what you are
talking about. If we are truly on the
verge of a revolution, it is to the men like
you, our foremost and ablest men, that we
must turn to save us. Therefore you
ought to be thinking of ways and means.
Here is a nation of nearly a hundred million
persons. If its government is so rotten
that it cannot last, what should be
done?"</p>

<p>But he declined to continue the discussion.
He merely laughed rather weakly
and some one just then introduced a new
topic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange to say, during the next few
months several other men were encountered,
who also bemoaned the "failure" of
our institutions.</p>

<p>Our children must be taught how to
meet such pessimists. They would probably,
in the light of recent developments,
say that they repudiate the doctrines of
Nietzsche, but they are really endorsing
one of his prime tenets, namely, that democracy
is bound always to be a failure;
that the "masses" should be kept down;
that all attempts to elevate "the herd" are
folly; that they should be made to observe
that strict morality, from whose shackles
the "supermen" are free; and should
submit unquestioningly to authority.
Women, even in the "super" class, are
made in Nietzsche's opinion, simply, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Milton says, to serve by "standing and
waiting."</p>

<p>One would think that men who hold
such views as this traveled guest, had
never studied democracy. They surely
do not understand its deep and splendid
meaning. They should be made to see,
as our children should be, by every means
that we can devise, the tremendous advance
which a democratic form of government
shows beyond any other that the
world has hitherto known. They should
have impressed upon them Elihu Root's
definition: "Democracy is organized
self-control."</p>

<p>Especially should they be told that universal
education and unselfishness of patriotism
are the only conditions under
which a democracy can be perfected; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that no nation has ever yet been sufficiently
educated and unselfish to arrive at
perfection, and probably will not be until
the millennium.</p>

<p>We all realize that our government has
many defects; but most of our critics
stupidly fail to recognize that our public
officials, instead of being our masters, are
regarded by us, and in no Pickwickian
sense, as our servants. We are all so
criminally busy with our personal affairs
that we allow our government to run
along almost anyway, often knowing that
grafters are in charge of it; but feeling
that it is cheaper to let matters go until
they become unendurable, than to take the
trouble to keep close track of them. After
awhile, we say to ourselves, we will have
a regular cleaning-up, turn the rascals out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and put in a new set of officials, who,
we hope, will do better.</p>

<p>Our children must be taught that this
is a wicked way to do. They must devote
some of their time to following public
affairs. They must understand also
that, while low salaries must usually be
paid to public officials, in order that
offices may not be too eagerly sought, yet
that patriots must be willing, when they
can possibly afford it, to accept these low
salaries, if their country is to be well and
honestly served. In this war, we have
seen many noble men resign large incomes
in order to serve the nation. We
must learn to do that in peace as well as
in war.</p>

<p>And we must all understand too, that
these officials do not really represent the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
governing power of our country, which is
undoubtedly that intangible thing called
Public Opinion. It is as subtly invisible
as electricity or gravity, but in this nation
as powerful.</p>

<p>In China, in India, and in most of the
other oriental countries; in Russia also,
as the recent upheavals there have proved,
there is nothing which can properly be
called organized Public Opinion. In
France and in Great Britain, there is
much. In our country, it is everything.
It dominates our whole social and political
system. Our press is sometimes said
to create it. Oftener the press says that
it follows Public Opinion,&mdash;while a considerable
section of our population declare
that the press and Public Opinion
are the same thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case, the child should be made
to understand that in a truly and nobly
democratic form of government, no czar,
no kaiser, no caste nor clique controls,
but the people themselves, who, as Lincoln
said, can be fooled by their leaders
part of the time, but whose sober second
thought usually sets them ultimately on
the right side. The child should be made
to feel that since he is one unit in this controlling
mass, he should form his opinions
with care.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent accusations
against us among foreigners, is that we
are wholly and ineradicably sordid. As
outsiders often put it,</p>

<p>"All that Americans care for is the dollar."</p>

<p>Most of us, when we hear this, share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the sentiment of a bright High School
girl, who took part in a debate in 1913 on
the comparative excellence of foreign and
domestic manners.</p>

<p>"I have just come back from a summer
in Europe," she said, "and I found there,
on the whole, much worse manners than
we have here. For instance, in nearly
every country where we went, we had
relatives and friends, and they were constantly
saying, and very rudely, I thought,
'Oh, yes, we understand your America.
All you care for over there is the dollar.'
But I don't care for the dollar and my
father and my mother, and my uncles and
my aunts, and our friends,&mdash;hardly anybody
I know, in fact,&mdash;none of them care
for the dollar,&mdash;not half so much as they
do over there,&mdash;and I told them so!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Her passionate plea brought forth
equally passionate applause from her
young hearers,&mdash;for it was true. Human
nature is inherently selfish and grasping.
We have only to read the book of
Proverbs to see that it was so in ancient
times and it will probably always retain
something of that meanness; but Americans
are the most generous people in the
world, and, as a whole, are the freest from
miserliness and avarice. Look over the
marriage notices of a century or more ago
in any English periodical, and you will
probably find mentioned there the amount
of the bride's dowry. We all know how
invariably it has to be ascertained nowadays
before a foreign nobleman takes an
American bride. Among ourselves,
there is almost nothing of this sort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>One reason, perhaps the principal one,
for this universal accusation, is not far to
seek. All foreign nations have their
leisure classes. The great nobles and
gentry often do not even manage their
own estates. Some "factor" or "agent"
does it for them. As for working for
money, the very idea would shock them
unspeakably. A woman who works for
money is especially scorned over there.
It is seldom that such a woman has any
social standing whatever.</p>

<p>Utterly different is the American estimation
of merit. Here we have a leisure
class, but it is so small as to be negligible,
and it is commonly despised. All of our
men are expected to work for money, or,
as we put it,&mdash;to earn their living, though
many of our rich men often contribute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
freely much time and labor to public affairs
and to philanthropy. A woman
who earns her living over here is quite as
likely as not to rank among our most respected
citizens.</p>

<p>As a well-known snob once said, "Even
in our first circles, you once in a while
meet one of these writers or painters, who
expects to be treated as if he were one of
<i>us</i>."</p>

<p>Thus Public Opinion controls our social
as well as our political life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SACRIFICING FOR PATRIOTISM</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Look back upon Washington and upon the
Savior-like martyrs, who, for our welfare, in lonely
dungeons and prison-ships, breathed a noisome air;
and when the minions of power came around day
after day and offered them life and liberty if they
would desert their country's cause, refused and
died. The great experiment of republicanism is
being tried anew. In Greece and Italy it failed
through the incapacity of the people to enjoy liberty
without abusing it. Millions of human beings
may be happy through our wisdom, but must be
miserable through our folly. Religion, the ark of
God, is here thrown open to all, and yet is to be
guarded from desecration and sacrilege, lest we
perish with a deeper perdition than ever befell any
other people.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace Mann.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>A LITTLE boy many years ago was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
marching down Fourth Avenue in New
York, his face bright with interest and
his whole air that of one who has important
business on hand. A gentleman
who met him was curious to know what
was in the child's mind and stopped him.</div>

<p>"Where are you going so fast, my little
man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the Bible House," replied
the boy promptly. "You see the
<i>Morning Star</i>,&mdash;that's the missionary
ship, has just got in, and I paid a penny
to get that ship, and so it's part mine, and
I'm going down to hear all about it."</p>

<p>The gentleman who told this story was
old, and the incident had occurred in his
young manhood, but he said he had never
forgotten it, for it illustrated better than
anything he had ever seen the effect upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the mind of a personal share in any enterprise.</p>

<p>The child who has worked in a garden
is likely to watch its growth and
progress with an interest which he could
not otherwise feel. In the same way he
can be made to appreciate his home better
if he has daily light tasks to do in
maintaining its order and comfort; but
these tasks should, if possible, be made
regular ones, and their performance
should become a habit. If they are done
only now and then, they are much more
likely to be felt as a burden.</p>

<p>The maintenance of the ordinary home
requires great labor and expense. Without
unduly distressing them, children
should be made to understand this, and
that it is only fair that each member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the family should do his part in keeping
it up. In the households of the rich,
such a course is hard to manage, for servants
do all the work; but in the average
home where but one servant, or none at
all, is kept, a little ingenuity on the part
of the parents will accomplish it, without
"nagging" or tiresome repetition.</p>

<p>In one family of five children, where
there was no servant, but where the standards
of the mother were high, there was
naturally an enormous amount of work
to do. The eldest child was a girl of
twelve, the next, a girl of ten. Then
came a boy of eight, and so on down.
The older ones were in school, but all
helped cheerfully in the household work
as far as they were able.</p>

<p>The boy of eight, who may be called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Chester, was a thoughtful little fellow,
and when he saw his mother rising at
four or five o'clock every morning to wash
or iron or cook; then, all day long cutting
out little garments, running the sewing-machine,
tending the teething baby,
or engaged in the never-ending task of
cleaning the house, his tender heart was
deeply moved.</p>

<p>He was a great reader and the lady
who superintended the village library
came to know him well, and often had
long talks with him. From his extensive
reading, coupled with a naturally rather
"old-fashioned" way of expressing himself,
his remarks were often of a nature to
amuse her, but she never laughed at him,
and so was able to keep his confidence.</p>

<p>One morning Chester appeared with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his weekly book, and as the librarian was
alone, he sat down for a little talk. His
face was long, and as he dropped into his
chair, he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Chester?" she
asked kindly.</p>

<p>"My mother is sick," he replied dejectedly.
"She is sick in bed. My
father got the breakfast, but he isn't much
good,&mdash;and we children helped, but we
ain't much good either. Not anything
goes right when my mother is sick."</p>

<p>"But she will soon be well. Probably
she has been working too hard."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," agreed Chester wearily.
"My father says so. He tells her to let
things go more, and she says she tries, but
she wants the house to look so nice,&mdash;and
see how well she mends my stockings,"&mdash;rolling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
up one of his knickerbockers,
"and it is work, work, work for my mother
from morning to night. Oh, Miss
Smith," concluded Chester in a tone of
anguish, "the lot of woman is very hard."</p>

<p>Miss Smith had never had such difficulty
to control herself as when she heard
this monumental sentiment from the lips
of this diminutive urchin, but she managed
to utter steadily, "Still, it must be a
comfort to your mother to have so many
good children to help her," to which
Chester gravely assented.</p>

<p>There are not many children who so
fully appreciate their mother's responsibilities;
but it is well that, without complaint
or whining, the mother should, in
such circumstances as those which have
been described, make her family understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that her "lot" needs all of the
amelioration that they can supply; and
they will love and value their home all
the more, the more they do for it.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of the affairs
of your town or city. If you do nothing
for it, you are likely to care nothing
for it.</p>

<p>In Miss McCracken's interesting book,
"Teaching Through Stories," she tells of
a little girl, who, from reading the story,
"The Microbe Which Comes Into Milk,"
became convinced of the importance of
pure milk. In this tale, emphasis is laid
upon the rapidity with which milk deteriorates,
if it is left standing in the sun,
and the harm which often comes to babies
in consequence.</p>

<p>A little later, a neighbor, who had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
small baby, reported that this child rang
her bell early one morning, about ten
minutes after the milk-man had brought
the baby's milk, and said anxiously, "Your
milk-bottle is standing out on the piazza
in the sun. Aren't you afraid it will spoil
if you don't put it in the ice-chest?"</p>

<p>It is but a little way from an interest
in the pure milk of an individual baby to
an interest in pure milk for all babies.
This little girl will probably grow up to
see that laws are enforced for pure milk,
and for the cleanliness of cows and stables.
Even though she may never develop an
enthusiasm for any other branch of politics,
it is a good thing to have one woman
working hard for pure milk.</p>

<p>All children can be taught to see that
good laws for such matters are a part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
patriotism; and that a man who does not
try to help to get such laws, even though
he may shout for political candidates and
hang out flags in front of his house, is
not a true patriot.</p>

<p>It is not often that one person can work
in many different directions; but if each
one will choose some reform in which he
is particularly interested, and hammer at
that until it is accomplished, he will have
done something fine for his country. He
may meet with all kinds of discouragements,
but let him hold on. Again, he
must be reminded that patriotism is seldom
easy.</p>

<p>Even after you have succeeded in getting
your ordinance passed, you may have
trouble in having it enforced. Worst of
all, the clever rascals on the other side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
may manage to get your hard-won law
repealed,&mdash;and there is your long task all
to do over again.</p>

<p>Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty
just as much now as ever. Look across
the ocean, and you see what it is costing
the nations of to-day. You think that
our fathers gained it for us in the Revolution,
and that, however others may have
to fight for it, it is secure for us; and all
that we have to do is to sit back and enjoy
it. On the contrary, some form of
tyranny is always just around the corner,
waiting to devour us. It is not impossible
that a wrong issue of this war may
force us to fight on our own soil again
for it.</p>

<p>In any case, there are plenty of social
and commercial tyrants only waiting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
lay hands on us. Sometimes it is a rich
corporation, stretching out shrewd tentacles
to entrap us. Its managers may be
philanthropic and courteous, even religious,
tyrants,&mdash;but despots none the less.
It may be a company of racetrack gamblers,
defeated for a while by a fearless
governor, but stealing back to power as
soon as his back is turned. Different
states may have different tyrants,&mdash;or an
arrogant party of socialists may "tie up"
the whole country. There is almost every
minute some movement going on, calculated,
if it succeeds, to hamper or destroy
our liberty. Mr. D. L. Moody once said,
when he was commenting upon this phase
of our national life: "Anything that is
going to hurt this nation we ought to
fight. Anything that is going to undermine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
this grand republic or tear out its
foundation, you and I ought to guard
against with our tears and our prayers
and our efforts."</p>

<p>Explain this often to your children. It
will strengthen their determination to defend
their country.</p>

<p>One of our young reformers in a public
address lately pleaded for a wider
recognition among the people of the good
work of honest officials.</p>

<p>"There are enough among us to find
fault when things are not done right," he
said, "but there are few who will take the
trouble to commend the man who does
well. He keeps on with his efforts,
whether he gets any praise for it or not,
but he is often immensely cheered and
refreshed by an appreciative word. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his morality is not of the heroic kind, he
may fall away and cease to put forth any
special effort to do his work well, just for
lack of encouragement."</p>

<p>He illustrated his point with the story
of the small boy who was sweeping the
sidewalk when some ladies appeared to
call upon his mother. One of them asked
pleasantly, "Is your mother at home?"</p>

<p>His rather rude reply was laden with
significance.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he growled, while
a slight twinkle broke through his scowling
eye, "that I would be sweeping here
if she wasn't at home?"</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that a well-fed,
well-clothed and well-educated people,
like the Germans, for instance, will bear
an autocratic government, which kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
does everything for them, but gives little
opportunity for individual initiative; it
cannot be compared, in its salutary effect
upon its citizens, with one which calls
forth the powers of judgment and decision
in every one, and feeds self-respect, discouraging
toadyism and caste, like a republic.
An autocracy, if wisely administered,
undoubtedly means greater order
and efficiency, until the democracy has
mastered its new problems and its people
have become thoroughly educated.
Rough working of new machinery is almost
inevitable; and the modern democratic
idea has not, even in our own country,
in the absence of the votes of half the
people, been allowed proper space for expansion,
though England, France and
Switzerland are hewing at it also. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
hundred years longer will show what it
can do, if demagogues do not overturn
it. If our republic fails, another will
arise upon its ashes, for the noble principles
upon which it was founded are the
highest yet conceived by man, and are
immortal.</p>

<p>This truth cannot be too early or too
strongly impressed upon our children.
There are enough men, like our distinguished
capitalist, who do not believe in
it. Their plausible arguments may undermine
the convictions of our young people,
unless we furnish them with solid
reasons for our higher belief.</p>

<p>As Mr. Benjamin C. R. Low has recently
written in a fine poem, "America
is so new!"</p>

<p>We are new. We realize that we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
an experiment. Whether this experiment,
the greatest the world has ever seen,
is to succeed, depends upon the kind of
patriotism that is instilled into our children.
They must be thoroughly inoculated
with the truth that both peace and
war make incessant, expensive and personally
sacrificial demands upon every
citizen, and that these demands must be
met by them, or else America is lost.</p>

<p>There must be no "slackers" in this
everlasting conflict.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PATRIOTISM AND HEALTH</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Entire abstinence from intoxicating drinks as a
beverage, would, with all its attendant blessings, in
the course of a single generation, carry comfort,
competence and respectability, with but few exceptions,
into all the dwellings in the land. This is
not a matter of probability and conjecture. It depends
upon principles as fixed and certain in their
operation as the rising of the sun.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace Mann.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>WE are accused by our foreign visitors
of being a sickly nation, and the numerous
exemptions from military service
among our young men for physical defects,
have reinforced their contention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Our ice-water, our ice-cream soda-water,
our custom of bolting our food, and our
over-heated houses, make it impossible,
they say, that we should ever be a strong
and healthy people. And so, of course,
we can never hope to be a "world-power!"</div>

<p>Many other indictments are brought
against us in this line, most of which, if
the ardent accusers would only think of
it, might be brought with equal justice
against every other civilized nation.</p>

<p>Thus, excessive alcoholism, in which
we have been said to be second only to
Great Britain, evidently applies somewhat
to other countries, in which the new
prohibitory laws are declared to have
worked a social and industrial revolution.
Drunkenness must have prevailed there
to a considerable degree, since the condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the people has been so much improved
by a prohibitory law.</p>

<p>We are all ready to concede, even
though prohibition has won to its support
so many of our states, that there is still
room for improvement in the public opinion
of a large part of the country, regarding
the merits of "wet and dry."</p>

<p>It is stoutly maintained in certain social
circles that the daily presence of wine
upon the family table is more likely than
its absence to promote temperance there.
This theory does not commend itself to
most of us, and our position is strengthened
by the facts recently proclaimed by
science, which go to prove that not only
do drunkards abound among the families
which serve wine upon their tables, but
that the use of any alcoholic beverage lowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
efficiency and is distinctly injurious to
health, in spite of exceptions. We always
hear of these shining exceptions,
while of the vast army of those who have
succumbed, no records are available.</p>

<p>Dr. Eugene Lyman Fisk, in one of his
interesting articles, states that recent scientific
researches have proven that "alcohol
has been found to be a depressant
and a narcotic, often exerting, even in
small daily doses, an unfavorable effect
on the brain and nervous functions, and
on heart and circulation, and lowering
the resistance of the body to infection."</p>

<p>The testimony of the Life Insurance
Companies and of the managers of athletic
"teams," is also conclusive as to the
deteriorating effects of alcohol; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
motive of patriotism will be found of
great assistance in impressing the desirableness
of total abstinence upon the
young.</p>

<p>We should all like to have our country
called the healthiest in the world. To
that end we drain our marshes, protect
our water-supply, make innumerable laws
for tenement-reform, street-cleaning, pure
food and so on. But all these measures
are bound to be more or less ineffective
so long as we cram our systems with
chemical poisons.</p>

<p>Make this plain to your boy and your
girl; and that, as the famous story has it,
as every deed was done by the early
fathers, "In the name of the King"; so,
in what might seem to be irrelevant,
though really germane and vital, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
should all do the right thing in the name
of America.</p>

<p>We all know well the absolute slavery
of men to fashion. The average man
would rather be racked on the wheel of
the Inquisition than to "appear out" in
a coat or a hat different from those that
"the other men" are wearing. Boys,
large and small, are quite as sensitive.
Mothers encounter angriest protests and
even floods of tears if they strive to impose
on their young sons any detail of
costume different from that worn by "the
other fellows." Women have long borne
the imputation of being the chief sinners
in this regard, but they are not. Their
brothers are even more tightly bound in
the meshes of the merciless despot,
Fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>This fact must be taken into consideration
in all efforts at social reform among
men, as a class. The independence
which can defy a hurtful social custom is
very rare among them. Many a man
who would "go over the top" without
quailing, lacks the courage to oppose a
popular social movement, though he may
know that it is of dubious benefit to the
race.</p>

<p>But true patriotism, to say nothing of
other motives, bids us discard every habit
and stamp out every malady which lowers
the <i>morale</i> or impairs the efficiency
of the people.</p>

<p>One of the most subtle foes of our national
health, and only lately dragged out
of its secret lair for the open contumely
and united attack of all good men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
women, is the most terrible of sex-diseases,
which is said to be frightfully
prevalent.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland Moffett, in <i>McClure's
Magazine</i>, pleads for specific sex-instruction
in our educational institutions. He
says: "The youth of America are taught
everything, with the exception of the most
essential of all, the great secret of life.
One result of this inexcusable neglect is
seen in alarming high school conditions
reported in various cities."</p>

<p>He advises home instruction in these
important and delicate matters, but admits,
what we all know, that few parents
are qualified to give it. Those few
should do so; but if the most terrible disease
known to civilization, and probably,
in a more or less virulent form, the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
common, is to be successfully combated,
such instruction should be imparted.
Under the circumstances, it must be done,
apparently, by regular teachers, who should
be high-minded, tactful and thoroughly
trained.</p>

<p>This instruction should be given to each
pupil separately and when alone with his
teacher. Two or three interviews, of
perhaps twenty minutes each, ought to be
sufficient each year. It should be possible
to arrange that number in every
school in the land.</p>

<p>There is another great curse which operates
especially against the health of our
girls.</p>

<p>A well-known woman is in the habit
of saying, "I have scarcely a woman-friend
who either has not just had an operation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
or is not having one now, or is
not going to have one soon."</p>

<p>This statement always raises a laugh,
but is no joke; it is a solemn, awful fact.</p>

<p>Now why are so many of our splendid
women, well-fed, living largely in the
open air, busy, educated, passionately devoted
to the study of hygiene and sanitation,
inevitably destined to be cut up on
the operating-tables of our hospitals?</p>

<p>Why,&mdash;it is so commonly expected, that
we hear of these operations now without
a quiver, even though we know they are
likely to be fatal. We accept them as
though they were decreed by an inescapable
Fate, and there was no remedy.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable that the Creator should
have made woman to be a natural invalid,&mdash;to
have powers and faculties which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
could never fully employ and enjoy? Of
what use are our hard-won educational
advantages, if they are going simply to a
band of sickly, half-dead girls and
women? It is a monstrous and blasphemous
thought that our Maker designed
women for such a destiny.</p>

<p>Huxley says that nine-tenths of the impediments
to women's health are not inherent,
but are due to her mode of life.</p>

<p>She was made to be strong and helpful.
Her body is wonderfully wrought
and fashioned for motherhood, and for
the accomplishment of the high spiritual
mission to which the woman-soul aspires.
One is driven to the conclusion that at
the root of her physical enfeeblement is
the costume which has been imposed upon
her by the false ideals and hyper-refined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
standards of past centuries, and of nations
which have admired most the class of
women who do not prepare themselves
for motherhood.</p>

<p>The costume which women wear is intended
chiefly to give an impression of
slenderness. It is not suited to the hard
work of the busy housewife, nor to that
of the cramped and confined office- or
shop-worker, nor to the life of the schoolgirl.
A hard-working man, dressed in
the modern corset and in the usually
closely-belted blouse of the girl and
woman of to-day, would fail physically
and resort to the operating-table as universally
as do his wife and sisters. That
so many of them survive the ordeal and
are able to perform some useful work in
the world is, says one prominent physician,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"one of the wonders of our time."
"Pauline Furlong," in a recent issue of
a widely circulated journal, begs that the
corset and the closely fitting costume of
the present be discarded, and replaced by
something light, loose and hung entirely
from the shoulders.</p>

<p>The recent remarks of Mr. Edison
upon this subject are sound. He says,
"There should be no pressure upon any
part of the body, if the organs within,
which require perfect freedom in order
to do their work efficiently, are to perform
their functions."</p>

<p>We shall never have a strong and
healthy nation, though we may make volumes
of sanitary laws, until there is a
radical change in the dress of women.
That, just as a girl is approaching the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
age when she is likely to marry and
bear children, the organs of motherhood
should be subjected to strong pressure and
largely deprived of activity, so that the
delicate milk-ducts are often atrophied,
and the muscles most needed to support
the child are weakened; while the chief
organ of all is frequently displaced, leading
to painful and sometimes fatal complications;&mdash;all
this is so discreditable to
the intelligence of our people, that future
ages will doubtless look back upon
our period as one of densest ignorance
regarding eugenics.</p>

<p>You may ask, "What do you advise to
take the place of the present mode of
dress?"</p>

<p>Only the experts in such matters can
answer this question. It seems likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that some combination of the best points
of the oriental costumes offers the best
solution. The new dress should be perfectly
loose; light in weight; should depend
entirely from the shoulders, like a
man's, thus bringing no pressure to bear
upon the important but loosely hung organs
of the abdomen; and the legs should
be allowed the utmost freedom.</p>

<p>Women who have long depended upon
a corset for support will doubtless find it
uncomfortable, or even dangerous, to lay
upon their enfeebled muscles alone the
task of upholding their bodies. Girls
who do not wear corsets will not "look
well" (according to our modern distorted
ideas) in any but the prevailing costume.
The dancers say that if a truly hygienic
mode of dress is introduced, the modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
dance will have to be reformed,&mdash;which
may not be the least of the benefits of
such a mode!</p>

<p>These are some of the objections raised
to radical changes in women's attire.
But the health of our girls, and especially
of our mothers, is a vital matter, and must
be made paramount. There will always
be causes enough for illness; but it must
be emphasized that we shall never have
a strong and healthy nation, in which but
a small percentage, instead of the enormous
one of the present draft, is rejected
for physical defects, until the motherhood
of the nation is properly equipped for
motherhood. Neither will our girls be
ready to fulfill nobly their new political
duties.</p>

<p>Nature is strong, and she manages to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
circumvent, to a certain extent, the obstructive
devices of man. There are apparently
many healthy children born of
tightly corseted mothers. The outer flesh
and blood of the child are made in the
obscure laboratories of the body more
easily than the later and highly refined
fabrications of brain and nerve. Are the
low average brain-power and the weak
nerves of our people, leading in so many
pitiable cases to moral and mental degeneracy,
largely due to our criminal neglect
of the conditions of free and splendid
motherhood?</p>

<p>But, if we want to become a healthy
and powerful people, what is more necessary
for us than strong and healthy
mothers?</p>

<p>The child should be taught that any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tampering with health is immoral. The
most conscientious observance of its laws
should be impressed upon every boy and
girl. Especially must we guard the
health of our girls, for their function in
the state is just now of vital moment, and
yet it is not so much regarded apparently
as that of their brothers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WORK AS A VITAL PART OF PATRIOTISM</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gurowski asked, "Where is the bog? I wish
to earn money. I wish to dig peat." "Oh, no, sir,
you cannot do such degrading work." "I cannot
be degraded. I am Gurowski."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson's Journals.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>SOMETHING has been said of the estimation
in which work and working for
a living, are held in our country.</div>

<p>In an illuminating sermon, Dr. Lyman
Abbott once treated of this subject. It
was on the Fourth of July, and he began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
by saying that the most important result
of the Civil War, as he viewed it, was
one that he had never heard mentioned.
Having thus enlisted the keenest attention
of his hearers, he continued in nearly these
words:</p>

<p>"Before the Civil War, the man who
worked with his hands was despised by
the leading element in the South. Supplied
with an army of slaves to wait upon
him, the average planter was spared the
necessity of exertion. He hunted in the
season, raced sometimes and sometimes
played an athletic game; but he held the
theory, broadly speaking, that no man
could be a gentleman (as most foreigners
believe also) who engages in trade or
pursues any mechanical occupation.</p>

<p>"The war changed all that. Many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the richest planters had to go to work.
Some of them had even to enter menial
servitude in order to earn bread for their
families. Then they found out that it
was possible to preserve their scholarship,
their refinement and their gentle manners,
though they worked hard every day.
It was an epochal discovery.</p>

<p>"From that time, the dignity of labor
was established in the South, as the Pilgrim
Fathers had long before established
it in New England, and as it must eventually
be established throughout the world,
if the world is ever to rise to the full glory
of the democratic ideal."</p>

<p>The chief, and almost the only argument
of the advocates of Child Labor in
our fields and factories, is that the children
thus become early used to work,&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
habit which is productive of the best results
in later life.</p>

<p>Carlyle's great essays upon work have
inspired thousands; and in Professor
Carl Hilty's wonderful volume called
"Happiness," there is an essay on "Work,"
which every parent should read. He
shows how laziness,&mdash;the inherent aversion
to work,&mdash;has been a chief obstacle
to progress in all ages; how hard labor
was so universally relegated to slaves during
early times that even to philosophers
like Plato and Aristotle, any social system
was unthinkable, which did not include
a slave class.</p>

<p>One of Professor's Hilty's incidental
remarks is worth mentioning. He speaks
of the many excellent women who observe
scrupulously the injunction in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Fourth Commandment to keep the Sabbath
Day holy; but who seem to fail to
observe the opening sentence of the commandment,
"Six days shalt thou labor";
often apparently thinking that one day
out of the seven, or even none at all, is
enough for that purpose. He feels that
the progress of the world depends upon
the combined and strenuous labor of
every living man and woman for six days
out of the seven,&mdash;with only occasional
vacations!</p>

<p>We are all probably agreed that every
citizen should know how to support himself.</p>

<p>One of our truant officers went to a
poor home to find out why a boy who
lived there had been absent from school
for several days. The mother reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that the father was in the hospital, and
that her only support was the small pay
which this boy received for holding
horses, doing errands for the corner grocer,
and so on.</p>

<p>The teapot stood on the stove, and the
officer said, "But your boy will grow up
ignorant if you keep him out of school
like this. Don't you want him to know
about tea,&mdash;where it grows and how it is
prepared for the market?"</p>

<p>"Oh," responded the poor woman, with
a practical common sense which disconcerted
her hearer, "I'd a dale rather he
should know how to airn a pound of it."</p>

<p>And in her desperate circumstances, it
was far more necessary that he should.</p>

<p>But in well-to-do households, where
there is not much work that a child can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
do, especially in the city, how can he be
trained up in habits of industry?</p>

<p>This is a problem which, as we have
said, confronts thousands of conscientious
mothers, who believe profoundly in Mrs.
Browning's pregnant lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Get work! Get work! Be sure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That it is better than anything you work to get."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Country children can gather the eggs,
cut feed for the animals, often have a pet
lamb, chickens, heifers or colts of their
own to care for. There is little difficulty
in finding "chores" for them to do. But
the city boy and girl are not so fortunately
situated.</p>

<p>All that can be done for them is to
devise errands, and to place upon them as
much responsibility for small duties about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the house, as you think they can bear.
They should spend as much time as possible
in the open air, playing in their
own yard or, under close watch, in the
street,&mdash;the playground of most city
children.</p>

<p>Every means that can be thought of
should be used to make them despise the
idea of idleness, and to love work.</p>

<p>A distinguished professor in one of our
great universities taught his classes that
work was one of the cardinal evils, and
that a prime endeavor of life should be
to get along with as little work as possible.</p>

<p>A mother of one of his pupils, who had
brought her son up to believe that work
was noble and honorable, and that it
ranked with the four gospels as a means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of salvation from sin, has never forgiven
that professor. He overturned in the
mind of her son the ideal of the glory of
work, which she had so painstakingly
erected there, and it has never been fully
re-established. No such man as that
teacher should ever be given a position
upon a college faculty.</p>

<p>When one reads of the childhood of the
vast majority of our distinguished men
it seems chimerical to hope that children
brought up in comfort, with plenty to eat
and to wear, should ever attain to high
positions. Most of our great men appear
to have struggled through seas of
adversity, in order to get an education
and a foothold in the world of literature
or art or politics or finance. We recognize
that it was the self-reliance and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
capacity for hard work thus developed,
which brought them success. We know
that it is a truism that poverty is the
mother of muscle and of invention.
Many wealthy parents have tried to supply
this great motive by depriving their
children of luxuries, and making them
work their way through college, or "begin
at the bottom" of some business.
This has sometimes, but not often, resulted
well; for, after all, artificial poverty is
only a blind, and the child has ever the
underlying consciousness that it is, and
that there is no real need that he should
much exert himself.</p>

<p>A lady who conducted a subscription
class of society women in their own beautiful
parlors, testified that their mental
inertia was lamentable, and that the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
two in her class of fifty, who really
seemed to have any capacity for keen
thought, were women who worked for a
living. They had to make their minds
nimble and bright in order to keep themselves
afloat.</p>

<p>In Professor Drummond's remarkable
book, "Natural Law in the Spiritual
World," there is a striking illustration of
the deteriorating effect of disuse upon organs,
in the highly organized crab, which,
when it finds a rich feeding-ground, attaches
itself to some convenient rock,
loses one by one its feelers and tentacles
and soon becomes a simple sac, fit only
to suck up nourishment.</p>

<p>Many of the absurd opinions and
nearly all of the sins of the so-called
"society" people can be laid to idleness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
The mind, seldom used to its capacity,
becomes dull and unable to reason, and
the moral nature loses its strength of conviction.
Nothing is worse for our country
than the increase of our idle classes.
Its salvation is the slogan that every man
and woman should work and earn at
least a living.</p>

<p>Our "leisure women" are realizing
their plight, and most of them are entering
actively into our great philanthropic
and civic organizations. The war has
given them a splendid opportunity and it
is a good sign for our nation that so many
of them have seized it. The idle woman,
whom George Meredith calls, "that baggage
which has so hindered the march of
civilization," is coming to realize her responsibility
as a citizen of a great democratic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
nation. The leisure man among
us is so rare that he is an almost negligible
quantity, for which we may well be
thankful. If we can get the child of
America started well in the ways of industry,
the man is safe; for one who has
experienced the transporting pleasure of
achievement, can scarcely help wanting
more of it.</p>

<p>"The phrase, 'economy of effort,' so
dear to Froebel's followers, had little
meaning for Dr. William James," says
Agnes Repplier. "He asserts that effort
is oxygen to the lungs of youth, and that a
noble, generous rivalry is the spur of action
and the impelling force of civilization."</p>

<p>It is certainly the "cue" of every patriot
who loves his country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The joy of work is well described by
Cleveland Moffett in the article which
has been mentioned. He says: "However
disagreeable work may be, life without
work is even more disagreeable. All
who have tried it, no matter how rich
they are, agree that enforced idleness
ranks among the most cruel of tortures.
Men easily die of it, as doctors know,
who every day order broken-down neurasthenics
in their middle fifties, back into
the business or professional harness they
have foolishly retired from."</p>

<p>The field of work for those women who
are obliged or prefer to support themselves,
is broadening hopefully. President
Woolley of Mount Holyoke tells of
seven of her recent graduates who took
part lately in a symposium at the college,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
all of whom were engaged in paying
work, but no one of whom was teaching,
though that has hitherto been the main
dependence of the wage-earning girl.</p>

<p>One of these young women was a
physician; the others were respectively:
a lawyer; an interior decorator; an editor
of the children's department of a well-known
periodical; a county agent in New
York State; a member of the staff of the
Children's Bureau at Washington; and
the Secretary of the American Nurses'
Association.</p>

<p>Such incidents make us confident that
the varied talents of our bright girls will
soon find as wide a scope as that enjoyed
by our boys.</p>

<p>And it cannot be too strongly emphasized
that regular daily work in early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
life is invaluable in establishing habits
of industry.</p>

<p>A common expression used to be: "He
has good habits," or "He has bad habits."
We do not hear it so often nowadays, but
the words are full of meaning. As a
man's habits are, so is he.</p>

<p>"Could the young but realize," says
Mr. Moffett, "how soon they will become
mere walking bundles of habits, they
would give more heed to their conduct
while in the plastic state."</p>

<p>It is then that we mothers must mold
them into the workers that we want them
to be, and we must use the patriotic motive
to quicken their love of industry.
In certain states this motive is strengthened
by laws compelling idle men to
work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Gair is the founder of what is
now the greatest "paper-products" business
in this country, and probably in the
world. It is located in the Borough
of Brooklyn, New York City. There
Mr. Gair, on the occasion of his seventy-fifth
birthday, made an address to his
employees, a portion of which, as reported
in the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>, was as
follows:</p>

<p>"No permanent achievement, whatever
its form may be, appears to be possible
without stress of labor. Nothing has
come to me without persistent effort of
the head and of the hand. Hard labor
will win what we want, if the laws of nature
are obeyed. Self-coddling and the
fear of living strenuously, enfeeble character
and result in half-successes. Hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
labor has no penalties. It is the loss of
hardihood through careless living that
brings penalties. Do the one thing before
you with your whole heart and soul.
Do not worry about what has gone by,
nor what lies ahead, but rivet your mind
and energies on the thing to be done now.
Self-indulgence and late hours produce
leaden hands and a listless brain, robbing
your work of 'punch.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Gair cast his first vote for Abraham
Lincoln. He enlisted early in the
Civil War and saw hard service. Less
than two hundred of the original 1,087
of his regiment remained to be mustered
out at the close of the war.</p>

<p>Surely his wise and uncompromising
words indicate one of the most necessary
ways in which our young people, who desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to show how much they love their
country and wish to promote her glory,
can contribute to it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PATRIOT'S MANNERS AND MORALS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Manners are the happy way of doing things.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Give a boy address and accomplishments, and you
give him the mastery of palaces and fortunes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The moral equalizes all; enriches, empowers all.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p></div>


<div class='cap'>A THOUGHTFUL writer upon
American customs recently remarked,
"The morals of America are better than
those of any other nation, but their manners
are the worst."</div>

<p>A certain mother once said, "I was always
so fearful that my children would
become bad men and women that I devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
all my attention to making them
good. Then I was shocked to find, when
they had grown up, that though their
morals were satisfactory their manners
were not."</p>

<p>Perhaps most American mothers are
like her. And that may be the reason
why we have the reputation of being the
worst-mannered of all the so-called
"civilized" peoples.</p>

<p>Still, the outlook is encouraging. Observing
critics have been heard to say
that the children now growing up, in
spite of many exceptions, have better
manners than those who have preceded
them. The public schools are more
careful regarding such matters than they
used to be, and so are parents. In fact,
if it were not for our numerous importations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from the countries which most severely
criticize us, our American manners,
on the whole, might be called pretty
good.</p>

<p>Have you not noticed how many laboring
men remove their hats when apologizing
to you, or offering a seat in a street-car?
Or say, "Excuse me?" when it is
proper. Instead of staring at a cripple
or a deformed person, as people used almost
invariably to do, in very many cases
lately it has been remarked that eyes have
been politely turned away and an effort
apparently made to appear unconscious
of the misfortune. Parents are teaching
their children to eat more gracefully.
More hands are neatly manicured. In
fact, perhaps we are going almost too far
in this direction. In one of the "Country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Contributor's" interesting articles in
the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, she says,
"Don't let anybody tell you that a lady or
gentleman must have nice hands. It isn't
true." She means, of course, that useful
work, which often spoils the beauty of the
hands, must be considered far more important
than the keeping of them immaculate.</p>

<p>Quarrelsome and ill-bred children are
still to be found among us, even in pretty
good families; but in spite of the large
class always present, who are chronic
complainers of the decadence of the
times,&mdash;a sure sign of approaching senility,&mdash;it
must be acknowledged that the
manners of the children one meets nowadays
are better than those of the last
generation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a confession of the impotence
of effort if this were not so. Thousands
of women's clubs and scores of women's
periodicals have been hammering at
"the bringing up of children," for, lo,
these many years. Add to these, the thunderings
of the pulpit and of the lecture-platform,
and we must admit that the best
ways that we know of imparting information
and inspiration are useless, unless
there has been within the last quarter-century
an improvement in the behavior
of our children. We must remember
that civilization is a slow process,
and one cannot readily believe that, even
in the millennium, there will not be some
silly mothers and some naughty children.</p>

<p>It is said that we behave better, so far
as outward signs go, when we wear our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
best clothes. Without fostering the love
of dress, which is likely to be fully developed
without help, especially among
our girls, it cannot be too strongly impressed
upon our children that they must
never appear before others without being
neatly and properly dressed. A principal
of a famous Normal School used to
instruct his students that they must always
dress as well as they could afford.</p>

<p>"It will have a good effect upon your
pupils," he said, "and it will help to establish
the dignity of your profession."</p>

<p>One of the few compliments which foreign
visitors generally paid us (before
the war) was that we were a well-dressed
people.</p>

<p>Perhaps this has had more effect upon
their estimation of us as a nation than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have some of our more solid virtues.
Perhaps it is really a sign of the possession
of solid virtues.</p>

<p>But, again, it is example which counts
more than precept in the case of manners,
as in everything else. If you wish your
children to treat your wife with respect,
you must treat her so yourself. If you
rise when she enters the room; if you
hasten to place a footstool for her; if you
apologize for passing in front of her; if
you hasten to help her up and down the
rough places; then your children will
do it. Otherwise, all of her and your
injunctions will have small influence.
There are good citizens and good soldiers
who are uncouth and awkward in their
manners, but a graceful courtesy clothing
the more substantial qualities will give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
them far more weight in the community.</p>

<p>One impatient boy complained to his
fastidious mother, who was bound to
make him a gentleman in manners, no
matter what else he might become, "Oh,
mother, it is nothing but 'Thank you,' and
'I beg your pardon,' and jumping up to
give people your seat, from morning to
night&mdash;and I get so sick of it! When I
grow up, I'm never going to say them or
do them any more!"</p>

<p>Courtly and polished manners are said
to be impossible among the mass of the
people in a republic. Let us try to show
the world that this is false. Distinction
of manner is not one of the great qualities
of a nation, but if we wish to impress
upon a somewhat incredulous world the
glory and beauty of our institutions, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
shall find the cultivation of beautiful
manners a great help.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyman Beecher once said, "What
a pity that so many of our finest and most
self-sacrificing Christians have had rough
manners! They have robbed their example
of half its force."</p>

<p>The current ambition that our nation
should be courteous as well as brave, is
shown plainly in the questions which
come by the hundred to the "household
departments" of our periodicals, especially
from mothers and young people.
Points of good behavior and etiquette are
expounded there so fully and so often that
there would seem to be no excuse for any
ignorance among us of the proper conduct
in any situation.</p>

<p>The printed answers to these questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
do not always commend themselves to
the judgment of the judicious; but, on
the whole, they are satisfactory, especially
when we consider that opinions of just
what constitutes a lady or a gentleman
have differed even among the best authorities.</p>

<p>Thus, the old English social doctrine
was that a gentleman is born, not made,
and that no amount of training could
graft the gentleman on one of humble
lineage.</p>

<p>Our own Admiral Sampson used to
say that "certain specific advantages of
training and education were needed to
make a gentleman,"&mdash;implying that gentlemanliness
is an acquired art; and so
the famous, but profoundly immoral
Chesterfield, would have defined it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
though he considered good blood essential
also.</p>

<p>Steele, in the "Tatler," observed that
the appellation of "gentleman" is never
to be affixed to a man's circumstances,
but to his behavior in them. Old Chaucer
puts the matter thus: "He is gentil
that doth gentil dedes."</p>

<p>The outside likeness to a gentleman or
lady amounts to little, unless there is a
kind heart behind it, for affectation and
insincerity are in themselves bad manners.
Huxley expressed it well when he said:
"Thoughtfulness for others, generosity,
modesty and self-respect are the qualities
which make a real gentleman or
lady, as distinguished from the veneered
article which commonly goes by that
name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Thackeray gives the best definition of
all, though his own manners were harshly
criticized by some of his contemporaries.
It was, "to be a gentleman is to be brave,
to be honest, to be gentle, to be generous,
to be wise, and, possessing all these qualities,
to exercise them in the most graceful
manner."</p>

<p>There are laws which forbid us to teach
in our schools any particular religion, but
there are no laws, as has already been
said in this book, against the teaching of
morals. Let us quote again Horace
Mann's strong words: "Morals should
be systematically taught in our schools,
and not left for merely casual and occasional
mention."</p>

<p>Few text-books in morals are as yet supplied
in our public schools, and little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
time is provided in the daily schedules
for lectures upon them; but one great
avenue to their understanding and attainment
is still open. In many schools
there is a story-telling hour at intervals,
and, as Miss McCracken and her co-laborers
have proved, patriotism and every
other virtue can be deeply impressed upon
the youthful mind by stories.</p>

<p>For instance, one of the most necessary
qualities for the development of a
strong and noble personality is courage.
Now courage is not merely not being
afraid, as Miss McCracken shows, and as
many of the anecdotes of the present war
prove. It is going ahead and doing your
duty, even when you are afraid,&mdash;as almost
every human being is, when exposed
to danger. Every one must have noticed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in reading the innumerable war-stories in
our books and periodicals, how many
times the soldier confesses, "My whole
frame trembled and my heart was like
water, but I kept right on,"&mdash;and in several
such cases we are told that some deed
of extraordinary bravery was done by
the faltering but determined man, which
earned for him some medal or cross of
merit.</p>

<p>To go forward, no matter how the body
may rebel, is the great test of courage.
This advice is especially needed by our
girls. Upon women and girls have fallen
many of the men's tasks in these days,
and great moral and physical courage is
needed to meet them. Among the other
inspiring words of Robert Gair are some
to fit these new circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most of you have more quality than
you know," he said. "Do not fear to put
your ability to the test."</p>

<p>Governor Whitman of New York, in
a recent address at Mount Holyoke College,
quoted these beautiful words of
Phillips Brooks, "Do not pray for easy
lives. Pray to be stronger. Do not pray
for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for
powers equal to your tasks."</p>

<p>Our great task is to preserve this nation
and its splendid ideals, so sacredly handed
down to us by martyr-heroes. Our children
must be taught that the task is great,
whether peace or war befall us, but that
God can impart the wisdom and courage
to perform it, and hand it down unimpaired
to their descendants.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great was brought up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be courageous, but his was chiefly the
courage of battle.</p>

<p>"Frederick the Great," said Mr. James
W. Gerard, our late Ambassador to Germany,
in a recent address, "is the hero
and model of Germany. His example,
coupled with the teaching of Germany's
leading philosophers, has built up that
ideal of force and dominion which has
been the undoing of that great nation.
This ideal must be entirely demolished
before they can ever resume that place in
the brotherhood of nations, to which their
gifts and attainments entitle them."</p>

<p>As a model, Frederick the Great is
repugnant to the soul of America. We
may not all be Christians, but the claim
that we are a Christian nation is justified
by the fact that our ideals are the ideals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Christianity,&mdash;of justice toward all, of
the love of mercy, of equality of opportunity
for all, and of fraternity among
men, of all races and creeds. Peace is
one of the grandest things on earth; but,
as Dean Howard Robbins reminds us, it
is only a means to an end,&mdash;namely, this
end: the coming of the kingdom of God.
If war is required for this end, then we
must for a time sacrifice peace.</p>

</div>


<div class='cap'>THE Venerable Bede wrote of a king
of Northumberland and his counselors
as debating whether the emissaries of
Pope Gregory should be allowed to present
to their people the Christian faith.
A gray-haired Chief told of a little bird,
which on a stormy night flew into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
warm, bright dining-hall. It was a
sweet moment for the bird, but his
surroundings were unnatural. He was
frightened, and presently out he flew into
the storm again.</div>

<p>"He came out of the dark, and into the
dark he returned," said the old Chief.
"Thus it is with human life. We come
we know not whence. We depart we
know not whither. If anybody can tell
us anything about it, in God's name, let
us hear him."</p>

<p>And thus came the missionaries into
Britain and made it a so-called religious
nation.</p>

<p>Our religious journals have discussed
from many standpoints the possibility of
making our own a religious nation. A
formally "established" religion is especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
forbidden us. We all admit this
to be wise, and that Church and State
should be separate. Yet there are few
thoughtful people who do not realize that
each individual has his spiritual part,
which must be fed and nourished, and
that this cannot be done by culture alone.
When a series of sex-films was on display
in New York, and good people were wondering
whether more of good than bad
would result to the young who flocked to
see them, one distinguished man said to
another, "Knowledge alone will never
make men virtuous,"&mdash;and no truer word
was ever spoken, as the spectacle of highly
educated Germany amply proves.</p>

<p>We are told that there are other forces
than the love of God and the desire to
serve Him, which may elevate and redeem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
mankind. That old Gospel, we are
told, is outgrown. By other means, character,
the banishment of injustice and
crime and the establishment of universal
brotherhood can be just as well
secured.</p>

<p>First, Science was to do it. "From
Huxley's 'Lay Sermons' of 1870," says
the <i>Christian Work</i>, "to the latest fulmination
of Professor Haeckel, we have
been hearing that Science was the true
Messiah, the eliminator of all evil." Science
was to be taught to our children in
the place of the outworn fables of the
Bible.</p>

<p>Then came the prophets of Education.
Herbert Spencer and his followers informed
us that education was the panacea
for all ills. Educate the people as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to what is best and they will choose the
best.</p>

<p>The prophets of Culture came next.
All that was necessary to bring in the
millennium was the diffusion of art, literature,
music, philosophy. The mastery
of the world by supermen was to be the
religion that should create a strong and
virtuous nation. Not meek men, not suffering
Christs, but giant men, by force
summoning perfect character and perfect
efficiency out of erring humanity.</p>

<p>Economic Reform was the idol of the
next decade or two. If we could get an
eight-hour day, one day's rest in seven, a
good wage, plenty to eat and model tenements,
then religion, as the Church views
it, would be superfluous.</p>

<p>During the last forty or fifty years, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of these gospels have been given a fair
trial. "Science," says Dr. Frederick
Lynch, "has driven the classics out of our
colleges, and has almost become the text-book
of our Sunday Schools,"&mdash;and yet
it has worked little improvement in our
national morals, and is just now devoted
chiefly to the inventing of machines and
chemicals for the slaughter of mankind.
Even airships have apparently been used
mostly for dropping bombs on playgrounds
and nurseries. Education was
never more general. Education has stood
next to the army in the consideration of
Germany. Many of our principal cheap
politicians and grafters are educated men.</p>

<p>Culture, too, is almost universal.
Every town has its library and its
women's clubs; and Chautauquas in summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and courses of lectures and concerts
in winter, are provided in our smallest
villages. Germany has boasted of her
culture, and we are proud of ours,&mdash;but
it seems to have done little more than
"to veneer the barbarian" in them and in
us.</p>

<p>All of the high-sounding promises of
Economic Reform have failed as utterly.
Germany's fine insurance plans, England's
old-age pensions, the higher wages,
shorter hours and better homes of the
working people, have proven but vanity.
"Be happy and you will be good" is not
the great slogan of redemption, after all.</p>

<p>Sects are vanishing, and that is well.
But the great ideals of the Bible, the
great Pattern of the life of Jesus Christ,
these are and ever must be the inspiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of the passion for righteousness which
we long to instill into our children. Science,
Education, Culture, Economic Reform&mdash;these
are good and necessary
things,&mdash;but they are, each and all, only
parts of the greater Gospel, and that is
what we must teach our children, if we
are to make them good citizens; for, as
a community without a church goes to
pieces, so does character without religion.</p>

<p>Familiarity with the Bible is one of
the essentials to this teaching. Besides
its ethical and spiritual power, its stories,
its poetry and its great essays furnish so
much literary culture that a man thoroughly
conversant with them is essentially
a cultured being.</p>

<p>One of our distinguished statesmen
wandered into a backwoods church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
where he heard a well-expressed, logical
and highly spiritual discourse from a
man who bore every mark in his outward
appearance of having always lived in the
locality. Upon inquiring where this remarkable
preacher gained his knowledge,
he found that he had always lived in an
obscure hamlet and that his library consisted
simply of his Bible and his hymn-book.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln obtained his wonderful
literary style largely from his
study of the King James Bible. Webster
recommended it as a model of condensed,
dignified and vivid expression. Thousands
of our best writers and orators are
indebted to it for the high quality of their
style, and many have so testified.</p>

<p>The work of these writers, such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Shakespeare, Browning, Mrs. Browning,
Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Lowell,
Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier, Sidney
Lanier, are full of allusions and figures
which cannot be understood by our young
people unless they are familiar with the
Bible. All of our greatest modern literature
is permeated with its language and
its spirit. Every child should know its
stories, should be made to learn some of
its grand poetry, and should have its ethics
and its spiritual lessons deeply graven
upon their hearts. We can truly say of
it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thou art the Voice to kingly boys<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To lift them through the fight."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"The child," says President Butler of
Columbia University, "is entitled to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
religious as well as to his scientific, literary
and &aelig;sthetic inheritance. Without
any one of them he cannot become a truly
cultivated man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If it is true that reason
and spirit rule the universe, then the
highest and most enduring knowledge is
of the things of the spirit. That subtle
sense of the beautiful and sublime which
accompanies spiritual insight and is a
part of it,&mdash;this is the highest achievement
of which humanity is capable. It
is typified in the verse of Dante, in the
prose of Thomas &agrave; Kempis, in the Sistine
Madonna of Raphael and in Mozart's
Requiem. To develop this sense in education
is the task of art and literature;
to interpret it is the work of philosophy;
to nourish it is the function of religion.
It is man's highest possession, and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
studies which most directly appeal to it
are beyond compare most valuable."</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt has recently given
us a fair definition of religion. The New
York Bible Society asked him to write
a special message to be printed in the
copies of the New Testament designed
for soldiers and sailors. He sent the
following:</p>

<p>"The teachings of the New Testament
are foreshadowed in Micah's verse:
'What more doth the Lord require of thee
than to do justice and to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with thy God?'</p>

<p>"Do justice: and therefore fight valiantly
against the armies of Germany and
Turkey, for these nations in this crisis
stand for the reign of Moloch and Beelzebub
upon this earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Love mercy; treat prisoners well; succor
the wounded; treat every woman as
if she were your sister; care for little
children; be tender with the old and helpless.</p>

<p>"Walk humbly; you will do so if you
study the life and teachings of the
Savior.</p>

<p>"May the God of Justice and mercy
have you in His keeping!"</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt had evidently in mind
the great prayer of George Washington
for America, well-known to most Episcopalians,
but not so familiar to members
of other sects. In fact, it is rather
shameful that so few know it. Here
it is:</p>

<p>"Almighty God, we make our earnest
prayer that thou wilt keep the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
States in thy holy protection; that thou
wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to
cultivate a spirit of subordination and
obedience to government; to entertain a
brotherly affection and love for one another
and for their fellow citizens of the
United States at large. And, finally, that
thou wilt most graciously be pleased to
dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy,
and to demean ourselves with that charity,
humility and pacific temper of mind,
which were the characteristics of the
Divine Author of our blessed religion,
and without an humble imitation of whose
example in these things we can never
hope to be a happy nation. Grant our
supplication, we beseech thee, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen."</p>

<p>This prayer may well be taught to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
every one of our boys and girls, and be
used by them in their daily devotions.</p>

<p>The Sunday School should be a nesting-place
for patriotism as well as for religion.
It is occasionally felt by some
among us, some even who are truly religious,
that the Sunday School accomplishes
little good. Powerful evidence to
the contrary, in spite of its negative form,
was afforded by Judge Fawcett of Brooklyn,
when he testified that of the twenty-seven
hundred men and women brought
before his court during the last five years,
not one had ever seen the inside of a
Sunday School. The Sunday School has
never been developed to its right capacity.
It can be made a tremendous engine for
the manufacture of religious men and
women, and enthusiastic patriots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>For that is what we greatly need
in this country,&mdash;enthusiastic patriots.
Dr. Jowett dwells especially upon the
value of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"No virtue is safe," he says, "until it
becomes enthusiastic. It is safe only
when it becomes the home of fire. In the
high realms of the spirit, it is only the
passionate that is secure. The seraphim,
those pure spirits who are in the immediate
service of the Lord, are the 'burning
ones,' and it is their noble privilege to
carry fire from off the altar and touch
with purifying flame the lips of the unclean."</p>

<p>Nothing will more certainly enkindle
this life-giving flame than the study of
the lives of great heroes,&mdash;first, those of
sacred writ, the patriarchs, prophets and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
apostles, of whom the world was not
worthy; then the noble army of the
martyrs and the brave men of the great
Middle Age; then John Wesley, John
Fox, Roger Williams, Whitefield, John
Knox, John Huss, John Calvin,&mdash;how
ignorant our children are of the thrilling
heroisms of the past!</p>

<p>Agnes Repplier, in one of her brilliant
essays, illustrates this disgraceful fact
with this anecdote:</p>

<p>"American children go to school six,
eight or ten years, and emerge with a misunderstanding
of their own country and
a comprehensive ignorance of all others.
They say, 'I don't know any history,' as
casually as they might say, 'I don't know
any chemistry.' A smiling young freshman
told me recently that she had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
conditioned because she knew nothing
about the Reformation.</p>

<p>"'You mean&mdash;' I began questioningly.</p>

<p>"'I mean just what I say,' she interrupted.
'I didn't know what it was or
where it was, or who had anything to do
with it.'</p>

<p>"I said I didn't wonder she had come
to grief. The Reformation was something
of an episode. When I was a
schoolgirl, I was never done studying
about the Reformation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We cannot
leave John Wesley any more than we
can leave Marlborough or Pitt out of
the canvas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. History is philosophy
teaching by example, and we are wise
to admit the old historians into our
counsel."</p>

<p>Walter Savage Landor devoted one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his most eloquent paragraphs to this subject:
"Show me how great projects were
executed, great advantages gained and
great calamities averted. Show me the
generals and the statesmen who stood
foremost that I may honor them. Tell
me their names that I may repeat them
to my children. Show me whence laws
were introduced, upon what foundation
laid, by what custody guarded, in what
inner keep preserved. Place History on
her rightful throne."</p>

<p>It is true that most of the great forward
steps of civilization have been made
by war. Our brave soldiers of 1776, of
1812, of 1847, of 1861, and of 1898, are
rightly our most revered heroes. Our
children should know the stories of their
lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>But the heroes of duty should be even
more emphatically impressed upon their
minds. It is true that warriors are soldiers
of conscience no less than others, but
our children will, we hope, need chiefly
the heroism of civil life, which, being
less showy, requires more of resolution.
Here is a tale of a soldier who kept his
courage in another place than the battlefield:</p>

<p>Colonel Higginson was once asked
what was the bravest deed that he ever
saw done in the Civil War. He replied
that the bravest deed he ever witnessed
was not done in battle. It was at a banquet,
where several officers had related
salacious stories, and the turn came of a
young lieutenant. He rose and said, "I
cannot tell a story, but I will give you a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
toast, to be drunk in water,&mdash;Our
Mothers."</p>

<p>There was a hush of guilty silence, and
soon the party broke up.</p>

<p>May our sons never be placed in similar
circumstances, but if they are, may they
show a similar bravery!</p>

<p>It may be remembered that a story almost
identical with this was told of General
Grant.</p>

<p>The lives of Livingston, of Stanley, of
Paton, of Elizabeth Fry, of Florence
Nightingale, of Julia Ward Howe, of
Alice Freeman Palmer, of Anna H.
Shaw,&mdash;of Wilberforce, of Judson, and
of men like the late Joseph H. Choate
should be made familiar to our young
people and a desire awakened to emulate
their example.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately the "path of duty" is not
often at present "the way of glory,"&mdash;but
it is a part of religion that the glory of
an approving conscience and of the final
smile of God should rank far above fleeting
earthly fame. The Boy Scouts, in
their excellent creed, embody this idea,
and so do the Camp-Fire Girls. Both
set up the right ideals, which is the main
object of true education.</p>

<p>"The Country Contributor" to the
<i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, feels that our
nation is suffering from a falling-away
in this respect, and that our ideals and
our strength to follow them are going to
be improved by the great war.</p>

<p>"We shall have heroes to mourn for,"
she says, "not moral degenerates, not
financial failures, not self-satisfied good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
citizens, dying of slow spiritual decay.
Maybe our men will wake up. Perhaps
new-born men may flash upon our vision
as Custer did at the Grand Review.</p>

<p>"During that three-days' march of the
Grand Review, somebody flung a wreath
of flowers from a window, and it dropped
upon the beautiful head of General Custer,
with his leonine mane of yellow hair
falling on his shoulders. His horse was
frightened and ran; so Custer rode, a
wild, beautiful figure of young Victory,
down the length of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Or like Phil Kearney at Seven
Pines, with his one arm still left and the
reins in his teeth."</p>

<p>Alfred Noyes, in the <i>Bookman</i>, has
pointed out to a scoffing man who has belittled
our heroes and our history, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
says, "There are no ghosts in America,"
the fact that we have abundant romance
and heroism within our annals, and names
some of the men and events which stand
for them, adding:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Must all those dead lie still?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Must not the night disgorge</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The ghosts of Bunker Hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The ghosts of Valley Forge,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or England's mightier son</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The ghost of Washington?</span><br />
<br />
"No ghost where Lincoln fell?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No ghosts for seeing eyes?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I know an old cracked bell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall make ten million rise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When his immortal ghost</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Calls to the slumbering host."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But the chief element in the child's
ideal should be democracy. His idea of
"classes" and of "masses" should be that
a democracy has none.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Imagine!" cried a gaily dressed young
woman one day, "that shop-girl is actually
trying to be a lady!"&mdash;yet that shop-girl
was gentle and refined and far more of a
lady than the silly rich girl who so vulgarly
criticized her.</p>

<p>"I wish we had more clearly defined
classes here in America," remarked an
apparently loyal American woman (she
was wearing conspicuously an American
flag brooch). "It is a much more comfortable
way."</p>

<p>She represents a considerable section
among us, who would like a return to
titles and class decorations in our social
system. You have doubtless observed
that such people always expect themselves
to be included in the gentry-and-nobility
class. Our forefathers, with a vision and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a valor far in advance of their time,
fought and died on purpose to abolish
such distinctions, and may they never return!
Some undiscerning ones insist that
we are as truly "classified" as is any European
monarchy; but they do not seem to
realize that with us caste and class change
with almost every generation. The great
name and estate are not handed down by
primogeniture from father to son.</p>

<p>"The only 'lower orders,'" said Horace
Mann, "are those who do nothing for the
good of mankind. The word 'classes' is
not a good American word. In a republic
there should be but two classes,&mdash;the
educated and the uneducated; and the one
should gradually merge into the other until
all are educated."</p>

<p>He summed up the whole matter thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
"The law of caste includes within itself
every iniquity, because it lives by the practical
denial of human brotherhood."</p>

<p>Teach your children this lesson thoroughly.</p>

<p>Pasteur defined democracy as "that
form of government which permits every
individual citizen to develop himself to
do his best for the common good." We
must come to recognize that "common
good" means not only the good of our own
nation but that of the world. May not
Pasteur's definition be used as a basis for
the great democratic principle to which
we look forward as the security for the
peace of the world?</p>

<p>The Athenian's patriotism was for
Athens. The Spartan's was for Sparta,
the Roman's was far more for the city of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Rome than for the empire. Ours should
be, first, for our own land, but then for
the world. It would be a traitor and a
craven who would in a shipwreck save another
man's wife before his own, if he
could help it. So patriotism, like charity,
begins at home. But equally true is
what Lowell wrote:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He's true to God who's true to man; wherever wrong is done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the humblest and the weakest, 'neath the all-beholding sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That wrong is done to us; and they are slaves most base,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose love of right is for themselves, and not for all their race."</span><br />
</div>

<p>De Tocqueville, years ago, reproached
his own nation with being willing to fight
only for its own liberty, while to the
Anglo-Saxon the liberty of his neighbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was also dear. Since then, France has
developed. To her, also, is the liberty of
her neighbor dear. May it ever be so to
us!</p>

<p>Perhaps the whole content of this little
volume is gathered up in Edwin Markham's
splendid lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"What do we need to keep the nation whole,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To guard the pillars of the state? We need</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The fine audacities of honest deed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The homely old integrities of soul;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The swift temerities that take the part</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of outcast right&mdash;the wisdom of the heart;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Brave hopes that Mammon never can detain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor sully with his gainless clutch for gain.</span><br />
<br />
"We need the Cromwell fire to make us feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The common burden and the public trust</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To be a thing as sacred and august</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As the white vigil where the angels kneel.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We need the faith to go a path untrod,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The power to be alone and vote with God."</span><br />

<p>When a young Yankee athlete makes up his mind to
play a part in the most thrilling game which the world
has ever witnessed&mdash;war in mid air&mdash;the result is certain
to produce a heart-thrilling story.</p>

<p>Many such tales are being told to-day, but few, if
any, can hope to approach that lived and now written
by Sergeant "Billy" Wellman, for he engaged in some
of the most amazing air battles imaginable, during the
course of which he sent tumbling to destruction seven
Boche machines&mdash;achievements which won for him the
coveted Croix de Guerre with two palms.</p>

<p>Mar&eacute;chal Wellman was <i>the only American in the air</i>
over General Pershing's famous "Rainbow Division"
when the Yankee troops made their historic first over-the-top
attack on the Hun, and during that battle he
was in command of the lowest platoon of French fighting
planes and personally disposed of two of the
enemy's attacking aircraft.</p>

<p>His experience included far more than fighting above
the firmament. He was in Paris and Nancy during
four distinct night bombing raids by the Boche and
participated in rescues made necessary thereby; he,
with a comrade, chased two hostile machines far into
Germany and shot up their aviation field; he was lost
in a blizzard on Christmas Day; he was in intimate
touch with the men and officers of the Rainbow Division,
and was finally shot down by anti-aircraft guns
from a height of 5300 metres, escaping death by a
miracle, but so seriously wounded that his honorable
discharge followed immediately.</p>

<p>Sergeant Wellman's story is unquestionably the most
unusual and illuminating yet told in print.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Barton first "broke into print," as the saying
goes, with a mystery story entitled "The Scoop of the
Session," which was published in <i>Collier's</i> a number of
years ago, and has the reputation of having written
more short detective stories than any other writer in
the United States.</p>

<p>In this new book Mr. Barton sets forth in absorbing
fashion the Strange Adventures of Bromley Barnes,
retired detective, but whose interest in the solution of
baffling cases in public and private life is just as keen
as in his days of active Government service.</p>

<p>Worried and harassed Government officials, also perplexed
and anxious private individuals, seek the services
of the astute detective in national problems and personal
matters, and just how the suave and diplomatic
Barnes clears away mysteries makes a story that is
mighty good reading.</p></div></td>

<p>As Assistant Professor of Business Method in Boston
University's famous College of Business Administration,
the author's lectures have attracted widespread
attention, and the popularity of his stories of business
life, which have appeared serially in important trade
magazines and newspapers all over the country, has
created an insistent demand for their book publication.</p>

<p>DAWSON BLACK is the story of a young man's
first year in business as a store owner&mdash;a hardware
store, but the principles illustrated apply equally to
any other kind of retail store. In bright, pithy style
the author narrates the triumphs and disasters, the
joys and sorrows, the problems and their solutions with
which a young employer, just commencing his career,
is confronted. Relations with employees, means of
fighting competition, and trade psychology in advertising
are some of the important subjects treated.</p>

<p>The hero's domestic career lends the "human
interest" touch, so that the book skilfully combines
fact with fiction, or "business with pleasure," and is
both fascinating and informative.</p></div>

out of the ordinary&mdash;a stirring story of political life
combined with a romance of absorbing interest.</p>

the affairs of a prosperous city, was forced to
admit that his unprincipled political methods must

<p>Cleverly the author depicts Edward Harrison, the
unscrupulous political boss; Jack Harrison, his son,
who differs quite a bit from his father; Mrs. Harrison,
the indefatigable social climber; and Alice Lane, a
bright, lovable girl; and around these widely different
characters Mr. Hirsch has written a vivid story of
politics, ambition, love, hate and&mdash;best of all&mdash;of
real <i>life</i> that grips the reader.</p></div></td>

stories May Carter and Gene Grey, who have won
countless friends among readers of the series, come
before them now as the center of interest. University
graduates, the two girls come forth enamoured of the
settlement idea, and proceed to carry it out at the
mining and iron ore plant of their father in the
mountains of Alabama, with the added interest of effort
among the quaint mountaineers of the region. Things
move at a lively pace from the moment of their arrival&mdash;things
unexpected and gay and tragic, which put them
on their mettle, but do not find them wanting. The
girls are much imbued with the new independence of
woman as well as with thought of her broadened sphere,
and Cupid, who lingers near, is beset by various unyielding
obstacles, but conquers in the end. The book
has for an underlying thread ideals of the same high
type which have characterized the former volumes.</p>

what you may do, but I know of one person who buried his
face in his hands and shook with the gladdest sort of sadness

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
